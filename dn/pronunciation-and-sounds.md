# Pronunciation & Sounds

The Dutch alphabet has 26 letters – just like in English. In fact, you don’t have to learn any new letters! Hurrah! However, there are a lot of differences and peculiarities in pronunciation. Some letters are pronounced differently, and there can be combinations of letters that may throw you for a loop.

**Pronunciation**

The way Dutch vowels sound depends on whether they are in open or closed syllables. A syllable is closed if it is in a consonant sandwich \(e.g. _bed_, ‘bed’\) and it is open if it is not \(e.g. _ga_, ‘go’\).

| Dutch | IPA, Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| A | \[ɑ\] \(short\), like in f**a**ther. \[a:\] \(long\), like in c**a**r \(Australian/New Zealand English\) |
| B | \[b\], like in **b**ait. At the end of a word: \[p\] |
| C | \[s\] or \[k\] depending on the vowel after the c |
| D | \[d\], like in **d**uck. At the end of a word: \[t\] |
| E | \[ɛ\] \(short\), like in b**e**d. \[e:\] \(long\), like in m**a**de. \[ə\], an ‘uh’ sound, like **a**gain; mostly at the end of verbs. |
| F | \[f\], like in **f**eather |
| G | \[ɣ\] / \[x\], the infamous Dutch sound. It sounds a bit like lo**ch** \(Scottish English\). \[g\] \(**\*g**oal\_, ‘goal’\) or \[ʒ\] \(\_baga**g**e, ‘luggage’\) in loan words |
| H | \[ɦ\], like in be**h**ind |
| I | \[ɪ\] \(short\), like in s**i**t. \[i\] \(long\), like in d**ee**p |

| Q | \[k\], only in foreign words and loanwords |
| R | \[ʀ\], an uvular trill \(rolling r in back of the throat\). However, there are more ways to pronounce the r in Dutch, depending on the place in a word: \[ɹ\] \(alveolar approximant, "tap r"\), \[r\] \(alveolar trill, “rolling r”\), and \[ʁ\] \(uvular approximant, German/French r\). |
| S | \[s\], like in **s**ock |
| T | \[t\], like in **tea** |

| nj | \[ɲ\], like the Spanish ñ |
| nk | \[ŋk\], the **ng** sound followed by a k |
| sch | \[sɣ\] / \[sx\] at the beginning of words. At the end of a word, it sounds like \[s\] |
