**It and this**

The word for "it" is **se** and the word for "this" is **tämä**. As in English, the latter can be used both independently and before a noun.

> **Se on pupu.** It is a bunny.
>
> **Se on kiltti.**
>
> kiltti: well-behaved, nice, sweet, good
>
> **Tämä on söpö.** This \(one\) is cute.
>
> **Tämä pupu on söpö.** This bunny is cute.
>
> **Tämä söpö undulaatti on tuhma!**
>
> This cute parakeet is naughty!

#### **To have**

Finnish does not have a verb for "to have". Instead the verb **olla**, "to be", is combined with a subject in the **adessive**. You can recognise the adessive from the ending _lla/llä_.

| Person | Nominative | Adessive | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st singular** | minä | minulla | I, \(on\) me |
| **2nd singular** | sinä | sinulla | \(singular\) you, \(on\) you |
| **3rd singular** | hän | hänellä | s/he, \(on\) him/her |

Sentences with **olla** follow the most-complete-noun-first rule, which is **why an object ending the English translation is almost always translated with an indefinite article**. Whenever the noun follows the verb, the verb always takes the same form: the 3rd person singular, **on**.

> **Minulla on koira.** I have a dog.
>
> **Sinulla on yksi pieni koira..** You have one small dog.
>
> **Hänellä on kissa.** S/he has a cat.

#### **What kind of**

In questions that begin with **millainen**, "what kind of"/"what...like", the verb is placed after the nouns and pronouns.

> **Millainen poni se on?** What kind of pony is it/What is the pony like?
>
> **Millainen koira sinulla on?** What kind of dog do you have/What is your dog like?

#### **Incorrect!**

The word **väärin**, meaning "wrong" or "incorrect", is an adverb, which is why it always appears independently and never attaches itself to a noun.

> **Väärin, se on undulaatti.** Wrong, it is a parakeet.

#### **Good dog!**

Grownup people are always \(fingers crossed\) _hyvä_, "good". However, Finns use the word _kiltti_, more literally "kind" or "well-behaved", instead of _hyvä_ when talking about children and animals. While some people may use both when talking to their pets, children are almost always _kiltti_.

> **Joni on hyvä mies.** Joni is a good man.
>
> **Kuka on kiltti koira?** Who is a good dog?
