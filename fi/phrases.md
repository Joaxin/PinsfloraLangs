#### **Sisu, sauna, and kantele**

**Sisu** is the secret, internal emergency generator that keeps you going when you have used up all your energy but there are still things left that just need to be done. The word is often considered untranslatable, but the American expression "true grit" gets pretty close. The corresponding adjective is **sisukas**.

> **Hilla on sisukas nainen.** Hilla is a woman with sisu/true grit.

**Sauna** is the most widely spread Finnish word. Although what constitutes as a sauna in most places, is considered in Finland a room that is slightly warmer than usual. Moreover, if you are not allowed to throw water on the sauna stove, it is not a proper sauna.

**Kantele** is a Finnish string instrument with a distinctive jingling sound. The first one was built by the great wizard Väinämöinen out of the jawbone of a gargantuan pike. Fact.

#### **Sorry and thank you**

Finnish does not have separate, short expressions for "sorry" and "excuse me". Both are translated with **anteeksi**. The word for "thank you " is **kiitos**.

> **Anteeksi, kuka sinä olet?** Excuse me, who are you?
>
> **Anteeksi Elsa.** Sorry Elsa.
>
> **Kiitos!** Thank you!

#### **Good luck and congratulations!**

The Finnish expressions **onnea** and **paljon\(a lot of\) onnea** can be used both to wish someone good luck and to congratulate them.

> **Tervetuloa ja onnea!** Welcome and good luck/congratulations!
>
> **Paljon onnea Matti!** Congratulations/Best wishes Matti!

#### **Well, hello there!**

The word **no** is a filler word used to make moving from one topic to another less awkward, or to make something less formal and in your face. It is usually translated as "well".

> **No, terve! Minä olen Otso. Kukas sinä olet?** Well, hello! I am Otso. Who are you?
>
> **Minä olen Anna. No, tervetuloa!** I am Anna. Well, welcome!
>
> **Jee, kippis ja tervetuloa.**
>
> yay, cheers and welcome.

#### **Bravo!**

The word **hyvä**, "good", can be used in the meaning "bravo" to encourage other people. You can use it to support your country or friend at a sporting event, or to thank someone for work well done.

> **Hyvä Suomi!** Go \(Team\) Finland!
>
> **Hyvä Aino!** Well done Aino!/Bravo Aino!/Go Aino!
