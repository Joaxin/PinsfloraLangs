# Introduction

German and English are in the same language family? German might seem tricky, but there are also a lot of similarities. Welcome to the German tour! Let’s get started!

## Capitalizing nouns

In German, **all nouns are capitalized**.

For example, "my name" is "mein Name," and "the apple" is "der Apfel."

This helps you identify which words are the nouns in a sentence.

## German genders

Gender is a way to sort all nouns. In German, every noun is either **feminine, masculine or neuter**, even when they don't refer to people. For example, "Frau" \(woman\) is feminine, "Mann" \(man\) is masculine, and "Kind" \(child\) is neuter.

While some nouns \(Frau, Mann, …\) have **natural gender** like in English \(a woman is female, a man is male\), **most nouns have grammatical gender** \(depends on word ending, or seemingly random\). For example, _Mädchen_ \(girl\) is neuter, because all words ending in **-chen** are neuter. _Wasser_ \(water\) is neuter, but **Cola\(-a\)** is feminine, and **Saft** \(juice\) is masculine.

For now, just remember that the **indefinite article** \(a/an\) _ein_ is used for masculine and neuter nouns, and _eine_ is used for feminine nouns.

Each gender has its own definite article.

**Der** is used for masculine nouns

**Das** for neuter

**Die** for feminine.

* -tion/-ie/-keit/-heit/-schaft/-ium/-ese/-ka/-rai but das Studium, der Chinese
* almost all nouns that end with **‑ung** are feminine. Plus, most nouns ending with **‑e** are feminine \(**der Junge** is an exception!\).

And we called this the nominative case in German.

Stay with us to find out how "cases" will later modify these.

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| der Mann | die Frau | das Mädchen |
| dar Junge |  | das Kind |
|  | die Zeitung | das Buch |
|  | die Milch | das Essen |
| der Saft | die Cola | das Wasser |
|  |  | das brot |
|  |  | das Bild |
|  |  |  |

> 1. It is important to **learn every noun along with its gender** because parts of German sentences change depending on the gender of their nouns.
> 2. The grammatical gender may not match the biological gender: "Mädchen" \(girl\) is a neuter noun.

There are over 1,000 types of Brot in Germany! If you visit Germany, be sure to go early to a Bäckerei\(**die Bäckerei**\) to try some freshly baked bread.

If you order Wasser in a German restaurant, you’ll get a bottle of sparkling or mineral water—and it’s not free! If you want tap water, ask for Leitungswasser, but be prepared to get some odd looks.

**Generic vs. specific**

German is not Spanish or French

Just like in English, using or dropping the definite article makes the difference between specific and generic.

I like bread = Ich mag Brot \(bread in general\)

I like the bread = Ich mag das Brot \(specific bread\)

A good general rule is to use an article when you would use on in English. If there is none in English, don't use one in German.

## Verb conjugations

### Conjugations of the verb sein

Like in English, _sein_ \(to be\) is completely irregular, and its conjugations simply need to be memorized. Again, you will learn the plural forms soon.

A few verbs like "sein" \(to be\) are completely irregular, and their conjugations simply need to be memorized:

| German | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| ich bin | I am |
| du bist | you \(singular informal\) are |
| er/sie/es ist | he/she/it is |
| wir sind | we are |
| ihr seid | you \(plural informal\) are |
| sie sind | they are |
| Sie sind | you \(formal\) are |

> If you're new to German, _ihr_ and _er_ may sound confusingly similar, but there is actually a difference. _ihr_ sounds similar to the English word "ear", and _er_ sounds similar to the English word "air" \(imagine a British/RP accent\).

### Conjugating regular verbs

**Verb conjugation** in German is more complex than in English. To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the stem of the verb and **add the ending** corresponding to any of the grammatical persons, which you can simply memorize.

For now, here are the singular forms:

Example:

**trinken** \(to drink\), **sprech**en\(to speak\),**spiel**en\(to play\), **mach**en \(to make\), **schreib**en \(to write\),**hör**en\(to hear\), **bezahl**en\(to play\)

**komm**en\(to come\),**geh**en\(to go\), **fall**en\(to fall\) **versteh**en \(to understand\),**kenn**en\(to know\), **lern**en\(to learn\),**denk**en\(to think\), **renn**en\(to run\),**bring**en\(to bring\),**schwimm**en\(to swim\),

**brauch**en\(need\), **beginn**en\(to begin/start\)

**leb**en\(to live\), **lieb**en\(to love\)

| English person | ending | German example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I | -e | ich trink**e** |
| you \(singular informal\) | -st | du trink**st** |
| he/she/it | -t | er/sie/es trink**t** |
| we | -en | wir trink**en** |
| you \(plural informal\) | -t | ihr trink**t** |
| you \(formal\) | -en | Sie trink**en** |
| they | -en | sie trink**en** |

### Conjugating irregular verbs

**And an umlaut on top!**

Some verbs change an **a** to an **ä** in the **du** and **er** / **sie** / **es** forms!

|  | schlafen**\(to sleep\)** | laufen\(to walk\) | faren\(to drive\) | waschen\(to wash\) | tragen\(to wear\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ich | schlafe | laufe | fahre | wasche | trage |
| du | schl**ä**fst | l**ä**ufst | f**ä**hrst | wäschst | trägst |
| er/sie/es | schl**ä**ft | l**ä**uft | f**ä**hrt | wäscht | trägt |
| wir | schlafen | laufen | fahren | waschen | tragen |
| ihr | schlaft | lauft | fahrt | wascht | tragt |
| sie/Sie | schlafen | laufen | fahren | waschen | tragen |

Keep in mind the **b** disappears in the **du** and **er** / **sie** / **es** forms of **haben**.

|  | **lesen\(to read\)** | **essen\(to eat\)** | **habe**n\(to have\) | **sehen**\(to see\) | Wollen and mögen |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ich | lese | esse | habe | sehe | will, mag |
| du | l**ie**st | **i**sst | **hast** | siehst | willst,magst |
| er/sie/es | l**ie**st | **i**sst | **hat** | sieht | will,mag |
| wir | lesen | essen | haben | sehen | wollen, mögen |
| ihr | lest | esst | habt | seht | wollt, mögt |
| sie/Sie | lesen | essen | haben | sehen | wollen, mögen |

Some verbs have letters like **d** or **n** in the main part, which can make them hard to pronounce when you add on verb endings. To solve this problem, there’s an added **e**!

|  | **öffnen\(to open\)** | finden\(to find\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ich | öffne | finde |
| du | öffn**est** | find**est** |
| er/sie/es | öffn**et** | find**et** |
| wir | öffnen | finden |
| ihr | öffn**et** | find**et** |
| sie/Sie | öffnen | finden |

### No continuous aspect

In German, there's no continuous aspect like French , i.e. there are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am drinking". There's only one form: _Ich trinke._

There's no such thing as _Ich bin trinke_ or _Ich bin trinken!_

When translating into English, how can I tell whether to use the simple \(I drink\) or the continuous form \(I am drinking\)?\*

Unless the context suggests otherwise, either form should be accepted.

### **What do you like to do?**

You can show that you enjoy doing something by adding the word **gern** after the verb. Don’t like it? Use **nicht gern** instead!

| Ich lerne. I learn. | Ich lerne gern. I like to learn. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ich lese die Zeitung. I read the newspaper. | Ich lese nicht gern die Zeitung. I don’t like to read the newspaper. |

## Plurals

In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as straightforward as adding _-\(e\)s_ at the end of the word. In German, the transformation is more complex.

In some languages \(such as French or Spanish\), genders are also differentiated in the plural. In German, the **plural form does not depend on what gender** the singular form is.

Regardless of grammatical gender, **all plural nouns take the definite article die**. This _does not make them feminine_. The grammatical gender of a word never changes. Like many other words, _die_ is simply used for multiple purposes.

Just like in English, there's **no plural indefinite** article.

| English | German |
| :--- | :--- |
| women | **Frau**en |
| men | **Männ**er |
| kids | **Kind**er |
| boy | Jungen |
| girl | Mädchen |
| book | Bücher. |

In German, there are many ways to make something plural. You’ll get used to the patterns as you practice! Here are a few of these patterns:

| add **‑e** | **die Schweine** |
| :--- | :--- |
| add **‑er** | die Eier |
| add **‑en** | die Frauen, die menschen, die Zeutungen |
| add umlaut | die Vögel |

### You, you and you

Most languages use different words to address one person, or several people.

In German, when **addressing a single person, use du**:

* _Du_ bist mein Kind. \(_You_ are my child.\)

If you are talking to **more than one person, use ihr**:

* _Ihr_ seid meine Kinder. \(_You_ are my children.\)

Some English speakers would use "y'all" or "you guys" for this plural form of "you".

Note that these only work for people you are familiar with \(friends, family, …\).

## FAQ

**In the German language, why is juice masculine and cola feminine?**

> There usually is no satisfying answer to the question why a noun has a certain gender. One simply cannot give an inherently logical reason why a spoon should be masculine and a fork feminine.
>
> When foreign words are adopted, they must be assigned a gender. There are several, often conflicting, criteria for which gender a foreign word should have: existing categories, suggestive word endings, the gender of the word in the original language, etc.
>
> Let's take _Baguette_, for instance. In French this is a feminine noun, and it ends with an e, both of which suggest that the word should be feminine in German, too. Nevertheless, it's _das Baguette_, probably because many other words in the bread category are neuter as well.
>
> Now let's look at _Cola_. English doesn't have genders anymore, so that doesn't apply here. The ending a certainly makes it look feminine. In addition, the category fizzy drinks has a couple of feminine nouns \(e. g. die Limonade/Limo\). So _die Cola_ sounds natural to many Germans.
