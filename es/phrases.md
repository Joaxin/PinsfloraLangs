# Phrases

You probably already know that "hello" in Spanish is "hola", right? But Spanish greetings and pleasantries don't stop there.

Just like in English, there are a bunch of ways you can say "hi", "how are you?" and "goodbye", depending on the situation.

### Greetings

Many Spanish greetings depend on the time of day.

#### Tardes and Noches

In English, "afternoon" comes before "evening," which in turn comes before "night."

In Spanish there are only two words that cover these times of the day: "tarde" which means "afternoon," but overlaps with "evening," and "noche," which means "night" but also overlaps with "evening."

Therefore, at 6:30pm it is ok to say either "buenas tardes" or "buenas noches."

#### Buenos Días

Even though "buenos días" literally means "good days," it is used in the mornings to mean "good morning."

Note that Spanish greetings are always in the plural \("Good days"\), but you might occasionally hear the singular **"buen día"** instead of **"buenos días"**.

### **¿Cómo te llamas?**

**¿Cómo te llamas(Cual es tu nombre)?** is used to ask **What's your name?** in informal interactions.

Hola, ¿cómo te llamas?

* Hello, what's your name?

**Me llamo** is used to say **my name is**. It literally means **I call myself**.

Me llamo Omar.

* My name is Omar.

Note that some Spanish verbs like **me llamo** and **te sientes** always need an extra little word before them.

¿Cómo **te** sientes?

* How do you feel?
* **¡Me siento enfermo!**

¿Señor, cómo **se** llama usted?

* Sir, what is your name?

Remember to use **usted** in more formal settings or when speaking to someone older than you.

Hola, señor. ¿Cómo se llama usted?

* Hello, sir. What's your name?

### ¿Cómo está?

Just like in English, it's nice to follow up with _"how are you?"_, _"what's up?" "how's it going?" "how you doin'?"_ etc. \(Although just like in English, don't always expect to get an answer.\)

¿Cómo está? \(How are you?\)\(formal\)

¿Cómo está usted, señor? \(How are you?\) \(formal\)

¿Cómo estás \(tú\)? \(How are you? \)\(informal\)

¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo andas? ¿Cómo va? \(How are you? \) \(very casual\)

¿Qué haces? \(How are you?/what do you do?/ what are you doing?\)

¿que pasa?

### Muy bien

Yup, just as you do in English, if someone asks you _"How are you?"_ you will usually say _"good, thanks!"_ Although just like in English, often the person blurting out a quick **"¿Qué tal?"** isn't really expecting a response.

> Blurting out is the best way to prove your Spanish level.

Bien, gracias, ¿y usted? \(formal\)

Bien, gracias, ¿y tú? \(informal\)

If things are a little better than "good" in your world, you can use one of these instead:

\(Estoy\) Todo bien / Muy bien \(Very good\)

_If things are a bit more so-so, you could also use one of these:_

Aquí estamos / Acá andamos \(Literally _"here we are"_, but it's usually used like _"I'm hanging in there"_, or _"I'm alive"_. \)

Bien...¿o te cuento? \(Good... or shall I really tell you about it?\)

Even if you're feeling really terrible, it's bad form to ever come straight out and say "**mal**" \("bad"\).

In some Spanish-speaking countries \(eg, Argentina\) people will often only say that they're "very good" when they're being ironic. If you hear someone say "**¡Mejor imposible!**" \(_"it doesn't get any better than this!"_\) — there's a good chance they're probably not having a very good day.

### Encantado de conocerle

**Conocerle** and **conocerles** don't have a gender difference they mean **to meet him/her** and **to meet them**, but the others.

**conocerla \(a ella\)** = To meet **her**

**conocerlo \(a él\)** = to meet **him**

**conocerlos \(a ellos\)** = to meet **them**\(masculine\)

**conocerlas \(a ellas\)** = to meet **them**\(femenine\)

Boy to Boy: Encantado de conocerlo

Boy to Girl : Encantado de conocerla

Informal: Encantado de conocerle \(a usted / a ti\)

Girl to Boy: Encantada de conocerlo

Girl to Girl : Encantada de conocerla

Informal: Encantada de conocerle

### Adiós

\(It's well worth getting familiar with **Hasta**. It's very adaptable and useful for saying goodbye, and it's easy to remember: Just think of Arnie in Terminator: _Hasta la vista, baby_.\)

Chau \(Goodbye, casual\)

Nos vemos \(Seeyou, casual\)

Hasta mañana \(See you tomorrow\)

Hasta luego \(See you later\)

Hasta la próxima semana \(See you next week\)

Hasta el próximo lunes \(See you next Monday\)

### **Buenos días, señor**

In Spanish, we use words like **señor**, **señora**, and **señorita** to show respect to someone. These words are often followed by the person's last name when you know it.

**Señora** is generally for married women, while **señorita** is usually for young women or unmarried women.

Disculpe, **señora**. \(Excuse me, ma'am.)

**Señor** can be used for any man.

If you are addressing people directly, you will just use **señor**, **señora**, and **señorita**, but if you are speaking of them, you'll have to use words like **el** and **la** before these titles.

Señor Sánchez, ¿cómo está usted?

* Mr. Sánchez, how are you?

**El** señor Pérez es americano.

* Mr. Pérez is American.

### Phrases

Por favor. \(Please.\)

De nada. \(You are welcome.\)

Hasta mañana. \(See you tomorrow.\)
