# Introduction\(no\)

> bokmål: A heartfelt welcome

Norwegian is a language with `simpler grammar` than many other European languages, but it is still a gendered language with three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter.

## Grammatical Gender

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| en mann | en/ei kvinne | et barn |
| en gutt | en/ei jente | et brev |
| en meny | en/ei hytte \(cabin\) | et smørbrød |
| en bok |  | et eple |
| en katt |  | et brød |
| en avis |  | et vann |
| en sykkel |  |  |

> All feminine gendered nouns can be classified as **masculine gender** as well. In theory, one could treat all feminine nouns as masculine ones, but most Norwegians still use the feminine form, especially for certain words.

The choice really is up to you! Both **en kvinne** and **ei kvinne** are grammatically correct, and the tendency to use the feminine gender depends on geography and dialect.

## Pronouns & Conjugation

Norwegian pronouns are very straightforward and correspond well to English ones:

| Singular |  | Plural |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **jeg** | I | **vi** | we |
| **du** | you, _singular_ | **dere** | you, _plural_ |
| **han**, **hun**, **det** | he, she, it | **de** | they |

As in English, the pronouns above only pertain to subjects. The pronouns at the receiving end of a verb, in other words the _object pronouns_, are as follows:

| Singular |  | Plural |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **meg** | me | **oss** | us |
| **deg** | you \(singular\) | **dere** | you \(plural\) |
| **ham**, **henne**, **det/den** | him, her, it | **dem** | them |

> **Han** is an alternative form of **ham**, but here we will use "han" exclusively as a subject \("he"\), and "ham" for the object form \("him"\).

Conjugation couldn't be simpler. All conjugated verbs have an `-r stem` in the present, and verbs don't change according to the subject! How easy is that?

| Singular |  | Plural |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **jeg er** | I am | **vi er** | we are |
| **du er** | you are | **dere er** | you are |
| **han**, **hun**, **det er** | he, she, it is | **de er** | they are |

| eat | read | speak | see |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| spiser | leser | snakker | ser |
| **drink** | **buy** | **sits** | **hear** |
| drikker | kjøper | sitter | hører |
| **viser** | **bor** |  |  |
| show | live |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

## Det & Den

Although not as common as **det**, **den** is used to mean _it_ or _that_ when referring to a masculine or feminine subject, and not a neuter one. **Det** is used to mean _it_ or _that_ when referring back to a neuter subject, and when introducing a brand new noun that has not yet been mentioned - regardless of the gender of that noun.

Den is for hankjønn \[masculine\] \(article en\) and hunkjønn \[feminine\] \(article ei\)

Det is for intetkjønn \["Ungendered"\] \(article et\) or used when the gender of someone has not been introduced or is not known.

## Definite Forms

The definite form, _the man_, _the woman_, et cetera, is formed by attaching the indefinite article onto the end of the noun. This ending is called a postfix or a suffix.

| Indefinite | Definite |
| :--- | :--- |
| en mann | mannen |
| en gutt | gutten |
| et barn | barnet |
|  |  |

Although the _t_ is pronounced as such in the phrase **et barn**, it turns silent in the definite form, **barnet**, which is pronounced more like _barneh_. This is the case with all neuter nouns in the singular definite form.

> Be sure to drop the _t_ sound, otherwise you might sound rather Swedish.

For feminine-classified nouns, there is one irregularity in the definite form:

| Indefinite | Definite |
| :--- | :--- |
| ei kvinne **or** en kvinne | kvinna **or** kvinnen |
| ei jente **or** en jente | jenta **or** jenten |
| ei øy **or**en øy | øya **or** øyen |

## Plurals

With few exceptions, most masculine or feminine nouns \(most nouns\) pluralize with **-er** or **-r**.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| eple | _apple_ |
| epler | _apples_ |
| gutt | _boy_ |
| gutter | _boys_ |
| jente | _girl_ |
| jenter | _girls_ |

Single-syllable neuter nouns, such as **hus** _house_ and **dyr** _animal_, often do not change spelling in the indefinite plural.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| hus | _house_ **or** _houses_ |
| dyr | _animal_ **or** _animals_ |
| barn | _child_ **or** _children_ |
| brev | letters |

How then can you tell the difference between **hus** meaning _house_ and **hus** meaning _houses_? That depends on context and adjective endings, which we will cover a bit later.

One exception to these rules is the Norwegian word for "man" which pluralizes in an irregular way that's almost identical to English:

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| mann | _man_ |
| menn | _men_ |

Here are some additional common irregular plurals, a couple of which are also irregular in English.

| Singular | Plural | English Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| and | ender | _duck - ducks_ |
| bok | bøker | _book - books_ |
| fot | føtter | _foot - feet_ |
| hånd | hender | _hand - hands_ |
| natt | netter | _night - nights_ |
| tann | tenner | _tooth - teeth_ |
| tre | trær | _tree - trees_ |

**Jeg leser flere aviser.**

I read several newspapers.

## Question Words

When you're just starting out learning a new language, few things are more useful than to be able to ask the questions that allow you to find what you need or further your learning.

Confused yet? We have just the word for you...

**Hva** is the word for _what_, and also happens to be just the right thing to exclaim when you feel like you've been hit in the head with one Norwegian grammar rule too many.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **hvem** | who |
| **hva** | what |
| **hvor** | where |

Isn't it neat how they all resemble their English counterparts? You've probably noticed by now that English and Norwegian have many things in common, both when it comes to grammar and vocabulary. This is because they're closely related Germanic languages.

We've compiled a list of common phrases in the Norwegian language, for your reference.

Many of them are idiomatic, meaning that they don't translate word for word to English. You'll have to learn the entire phrase.

One example is "**Ha detbra!**", which literally means "Have it good!", but idiomatically translates to "Goodbye!"

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ha det\(bra\)!** | Goodbye! |
| **Hvordan har du det?** | How are you? |
| **Hvordan går det?** | How is it going? |
| **Bare bra, takk!** | Just fine, thanks! |
| **Bare hyggelig!** | You are welcome |
| **Tusen Takk!** | Thank you very much! |
| **Jeg har det bra.** | I'm doing well. |
| **Vi ses!** | See you later! |
| **unnskyld** | sorry, excuse me, pardon |
| **vær så snill** | please, be so kind |
| **Hva heter du?** | What is your name? |
| **Hva har hun?** | What does she have? |
| **Der er dere!** | There you are! |
| **God helg og god tur!** | Have a nice weekend and a nice trip! |
| **Ha en hyggelig dag!** | Have a nice day |

> Hva: E=hv Hovordan:Jordan

## Knowing

The verb **å vite**, _to know_, is an irregular verb in Norwegian. Its present tense, which you will familiarize yourself with in this skill, is **vet**. See that vowel change from the infinitive to the present? Cheeky!

There are actually several verbs for knowing, and you'll get to know them all in due time, but this particular one deals with factual knowledge. Some examples of that is knowing what or where something is, or knowing something about something or someone.

> **Vet du hvor det er?** Do you know where it is?
>
> **Vet du hvem hun er?** Do you know who she is?
>
> **Hva vet han?**
>
> What does he know?
