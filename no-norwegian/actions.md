## Present

The present tense is used to describe things that are happening or are true now:

> **Jeg leser n책.** I am reading now.

The present tense is also in general statements that are independent of time:

> **Jorda er rund.** The earth is round.

For things that repeat and that are still recurring:

> **Jeg sover hver natt.** I sleep every night.

The present tense can be used to talk about the future as well, especially when it is certain:

> **Jeg reiser i morgen.** I leave tomorrow.

As a rule of thumb, you can use the present tense where you would use either the present \(_I leave tomorrow._\) or present progressive \(_I am leaving tomorrow._\) tenses in English.

You do not have to worry about person or number when dealing with verbs in Norwegian, the verb stays the same. This is even simpler than English where you have to remember to add the _-s_ in the third person singular in the present tense.

Forming the present is extremely easy, just add the suffix _-r_ to the infinitive \(the form you'll find in the dictionary\).

The table below shows you how to do it:

| Infinitive | Present | English Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 책 spise | spise**r** | eat\(s\), am/are/is eating |
| 책 drikke | drikke**r** | drink\(s\), am/are/is drinking |
| 책 se | se**r** | see\(s\), am/are/is seeing |
