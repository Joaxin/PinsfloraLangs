# Pronunciation\(no\)

As a general rule, words are spelled as they're pronounced in Norwegian. One exception is words beginning with **hv**, such as **hva**, meaning _what_. In this word, the **h** is silent.

In addition, there are several letters and letter combinations that are pronounced differently from English.

| Norweg. | IPA, Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| A | \[ɑ\], very open |
| B | \[b\] |
| C | \[s\] or \[k\] depending on word, very rare |
| D | \[d\], silent in consonant clusters |
| E | \[e\] or \[ɛ\], \[æ\] in _her_ and _der_, \[i\] in _de_ |
| F | \[f\] |
| G | \[g\], \[j\] before an i; silent before a j; silent after an i and sometimes an a or o |
| H | \[h\], silent before v |
| I | \[i\] like the _e_ in _email_ or _ebook_, \[ɪ\] before two consonants |
| J | \[j\], like the _y_ in _yes_ or _yellow_ |
| K | \[k\] |
| kj, ki, ky | \[ç\], like the sharp _h_ in _human_ |
| L | \[l\] |
| M | \[m\] |
| N | \[n\] |
| O | \[u\] like the _oo_ in _soon_, but longer, \[ʊ\] before two consonants |
| P | \[p\] |
| R | \[ɾ\], tap, like the _tt_ in North American _butter_; some in Norway use \[ʁ\], the so-called _French R_ |
| rs | \[ʃ\], _r_ + _s_ combinations produce _sh_ sound, even between words |
| S | \[s\] |
| skj, ski, sky, sl | \[ʃ\], like the _sh_ in _ship_ or _shell_ |
| T | \[t\], silent after an e sometimes, ex. _det_ |
| U | \[ʉ\], like the _ew_ in _new_, but more closed |
| V | \[v\] |
| Y | \[y\] or \[ʏ\], like the _e_ in _email_, but more closed |

## Norwegian vowels

Norwegian also has three special Norwegian vowels, **Æ**, **Ø** and **Å**.

| - | Similar To | IPA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Æ | the _a_ in _add_ or _apple_ | \[æ\] |
| Ø | no real equivalent, but not far from the vowel sounds in _bird_ or _earth_ | \[ø\] or \[œ\] |
| Å | the _o_ in _open_ or _old_ | \[o\] or \[ɔ\] |

> When you have no other option, you can use these replacement characters, but don't get into the habit of relying on them, as it will be a hard one to break.

| Character | Replacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Æ** | AE |
| **Ø** | OE |
| **Å** | AA |
