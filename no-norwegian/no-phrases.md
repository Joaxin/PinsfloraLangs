# Phrases\(no\)

I hope you've been enjoying your Norwegian learning thus far. There are a lot of new things to take on board in these early skills, but don't worry if everything doesn't stick right away; you're going to get plenty of revision of the basic concepts as you move through the course.

## Greetings

Below is a list of common greetings in the Norwegian language, for your reference.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hei** | _Hi_ |
| **Hallo** | _Hello_ |
| **God dag** | Good day; Good afternoon |
| **God morgen**\(en\) | Good morning |
| **God kveld**\(en\) | Good evening |
| **Ha en god kveld!** | Have a nice evening! |
| **God natt**\(en,ei\) | Good night |
| **God helg**\(en,ei\) | Good weekend |
| **Vær så god** | You're welcome. |

## Thank you

Takk. Thank you.

## Sorry

Unnskyld. Excuse me.

Beklager. I am sorry.

## Languages and Nationalities

In Norwegian, most names of languages are derived from the name of the country, the adjective or the nationality with the ending **–sk** at the end. Below are a few examples.

| Country | Adjective | Nationality | Language |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Norge** - _Norway_ | **norsk** - _Norwegian_ | **en nordmann** - _a Norwegian_ | **norsk** - _Norwegian \(language\)_ |
| **England** - _England_ | **engelsk** - _English_ | **en engelskmann** - _an Englishman_ | **engelsk** - _English \(language\)_ |
| **Frankrike** - _France_ | **fransk** - _French_ | **en franskmann** - _a Frenchman_ | **fransk** - _French \(language\)_ |

As you may have noticed above, Norwegians do not capitalize adjectives, nationalities or languages, only countries. All words are capitalized if they come at the beginning of the sentence, just like in English.
