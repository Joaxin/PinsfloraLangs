## French vowels

| French vowels |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| ch**a**t | as in "f**a**ther" |
| nu**i**t , p**i**zza | as in "L**i**sa" |
| j**e** | as in "p**e**tition" |
| h**o**mme, gr**o**s | \(as in "**o**r" |
| t**u** , sal**u**t | say "**ee**" while puckering your lips |

> To practice the French **u**, round your lips \(pucker up, buttercup!\) and say **ee**.

## **Accents**

In French, an accent mark over a letter can make a new sound.

j**e** \(as in "p**e**tition"\)

journ**é**e \(similar to "b**ay**"\)

tr**è**s \(as in "b**e**t"\)

If the last letter of a word is an **e** \(without an accent!\), it's usually silent.

## French word endings

French word endings tend to be particularly difficult for beginners, largely because ending consonants are usually silent, but they do affect preceding vowel sounds.

| Ending | Homophones | Example | English Approximation | IPA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -er | -é, -ée, -ées | parler | cliché | \[e\] |
| -et | -ets, -è, -ê | poulet | pou-LAY | \[ε\] |
| -it | -its, -i, -ie, -ies, -is, -iz | lit | LEE | \[i\] |
| -at | -ats, -as, -a | chat | SHAH | \[ɑ\] |

The consonants C, R, F, and L are usually pronounced \(you can use the mnemonic "CaReFuL"\), with these main exceptions:

* An ending _-r_ is silent in infinitives \(e.g. _parler_ - to speak\).
* An ending _-fs_ is silent \(e.g. _œufs_ - eggs\).
* The L of an ending _-il_ is usually silent \(e.g. _fusil_ - gun\).

## Words Beginning with H

The letter H is always mute \(silent\) in French, but when H starts a word, it can act as a consonant \(aspirate\) or vowel \(non-aspirate\). For example, the H in _homme_ acts as a vowel. This means that "the man" must be written as _l'homme_.

Conversely, an aspirate H doesn't participate in elisions or liaisons. It's usually found at the beginning of loanwords from German or other languages. For instance, "the hero" is _le héros_.

## The Mute E

When a consonant is followed by a mute _-e_, then the consonant should be pronounced. This is a way of distinguishing masculine and feminine forms verbally. Any unaccented _-e_ at the end of a word is always mute except in a single-syllable word like _le_, which sounds somewhat like "luh".

The letter E often becomes mute in the middle of a word, especially if it would add a syllable. For instance, most Francophones pronounce _appeler_ \("to call"\) as "app-LAY", not "app-pe-LAY".
