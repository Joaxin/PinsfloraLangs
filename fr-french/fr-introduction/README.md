# Introduction\(fr\)

## Genders

French has two grammatical genders: **masculine** and **feminine**. All nouns have a gender, and most nouns have a fixed gender. For instance, la pomme is always feminine and un bébé \("a baby"\) is always masculine, even for baby girls.

> All nouns have a gender that you must memorize.

| French |  | French |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Le garçon | boy | la fille | girl |
| L'homme | man | La femme | woman |
| L'enfant | child can be a boy or a girl | l'eau | water |
| le lettre | letter | la lettre | letter, alphabet |
| le café | coffee | la pomme | apple |
| le français |  | la Chine | China |
| le Petit Prince |  | la bière | beer |
| le menu | menu | la orange | orange |

However, some nouns can have multiple genders depending on the situation, and many masculine nouns can be changed to a feminine form simply by adding an **-e** to the end. Your male friend is un ami and your female friend is une amie. Some nouns, like l'élève \("the student"\), have the same spelling and meaning for both gender forms.

Other nouns may have the same spelling, but different genders and meanings. For instance, un tour \(masculine\) is a tour, while une tour \(feminine\) is a tower.

One of the most difficult aspects of learning French is memorizing noun genders. However, by spending some time now memorizing the following patterns, you may be able to guess most nouns' genders and save yourself a lot of trouble in the future.

Some genders depend on a noun's classification. For instance, **languages, days of the week, months, seasons, metals, colors, and measurements are mostly masculine**.

Otherwise, memorizing word endings is the best way to guess genders. We'll learn these ending patterns in four steps:

* First: Nouns ending in -e tend to be feminine. All others, especially nouns ending in consonants, tend to be masculine. This is true for over 70% of all nouns.
* Second: Nouns that have the endings -ion and -son tend to be feminine, even though they end in consonants.
* Third: Nouns with these endings are usually masculine, although they end in -e:

  -tre, -ble, -cle \(think "treble clef"\) -one, -ème, -ège \(think "OMG"\) -age, -isme

* Fourth: Watch out for these complications:

  **-é** is masculine, but -té is feminine.

  * le résumé \(masc\) — the resumé  la liberté \(fem\) — the liberty 

  **-de** is masculine, but -ade, -nde, and -ude are feminine.

  * le guide — the guide la parade — the parade 

  **-ste** and **-me** tend to be masculine, but there are dozens of exceptions. Words for people ending in -ste are often gender-neutral, e.g. le/la cycliste.

  **-eur** is masculine for most professions or technical terms, but it's feminine for some emotions and abstract things.

  * le chauffeur — the driver la peur — the fear 

That's it! Memorize these, and you'll be able to guess most noun genders.

## Articles

**Articles** \(e.g. "the" or "a"\) provide context for a noun. In English, articles may be omitted, but French nouns almost always have an article.

French has three types of articles:

* **Definite articles** \(the\) : nouns that are known to the speakers / the general sense of a noun
* **Indefinite articles** \(a/an/one\) : countable nouns that are unspecified or unknown to the speakers
* **Partitive articles** \(some/any\) : quantity of something uncountable

_Le_ and _la_ become just **l'** if they're followed by a `vowel sound`. This is an example of **elision**, which is the removal of a vowel sound in order to prevent consecutive vowel sounds and make pronunciation easier.

Elisions are mandatory—for instance, _je aime_ is incorrect. It must be _j'aime_. These other one-syllable words can also elide: _**je**_**,** _**me**_**,** _**te**_**,** _**se**_**,** _**de**_**,** _**ce**_**,** _**ne**_**, and** _**que**_**.**

_Tu_ can also be elided in casual speech, but not in writing.

| Article | Masculine | Feminine | Plural | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Definite | le/l' | la/l' | les | **le** _chat_ — the cat |
| Indefinite | un | une | des | **une** _femme_ — a woman |
| Partitive | du/de l' | de la/de l' |  | **de l**'eau— \(some\) water |

In a **contraction**, two words combine to form one shortened word. For instance, the partitive article _du_ is a contraction of the preposition _de_ with _le_.

* _du pain_ — \(some\) bread

  However, since _du_ can create vowel conflicts, when it would appear in front of a `vowel sound`, it takes the elided _de l'_ form instead. This is also the case for _de la_.

* _de l'**a**nanas_ \[masc.\] — \(some\) pineapple
* _de l'**e**au_ \[fem.\] — \(some\) water

## Personal Subject Pronouns

The **subject** is the person or thing that performs an action or is being described.

This is often a noun, but a **personal subject pronoun**\(e.g. "I", "you", or "he"\).

Notice above that the verb **manger** \(as well as its English equivalent, "to eat"\) changes form to agree grammatically with the subject. These forms are called **conjugations** of that verb.

| subject | _Être_ \(To Be\) | _Avoir_ \(To Have\) | _Mang\|er_ \(To Eat\) | Parl\|er\(To Speak\) | Li\|re\(To Read\) | Boi\|re \(To Drink\) | écri\|re\(To Write\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| je | suis | \(j'\)ai | mange | parle | lis | bois | \(j'\)écris |
| tu/vous | es | as | manges | parles | lis | bois | écris |
| il/elle/on | est | a | mange | parle | lit | boit | écrit |
| nous | sommes | avons | mangeons | **parlons** | **lisons** | buvons | écrivons |
| vous | êtes | avez | mangez | parlez | lisez | buvez | écrivez |
| ils/elles | sont | ont | mangent | parlent | lisent | biovent | écrivent |

French has two words for the subject pronoun "you": **tu** and **vous**. For a singular "you", _tu_ should only be used for friends, peers, relatives, children, or anyone else who's very familiar to you.

In all other cases and also for plurals, the more polite _vous_ should be used to show respect. When in doubt, use _vous_.

## Plurals

Many French words have plural forms. Plural nouns and adjectives can be formed by appending an _-s_ to the singular, but remember that this _-s_ is usually silent.

* _homme_ \("man"\) ⇒ _hommes_ \("men"\)
* _femme_ \("woman"\) ⇒ _femmes_ \("women"\)
* _chat noir_ \("black cat"\) ⇒ _chats noirs_ \("black cats"\)

Pronouns, adjectives, and articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number. Consider the examples below and note how the article and adjective change to agree with each noun.

* Masculine singular: _Le chat noir_ — The black cat
* Masculine plural: _Les chats noirs_ — The black cats
* Feminine singular: _La robe noire_ — The black dress
* Feminine plural: _Les robes noires_ — The black dresses

**Notes** : Not all adjectives change forms. For instance, _riche_ is the same for both masculine and feminine singular nouns.

## Gallicism

A gallicism is a phrase or grammatical construction peculiar to the French language.

When describing people and things with a noun after _être_ in French, you usually can't use the personal subject pronoun like _il_, _elle_, _ils_, and _elles_. Instead, you must use the impersonal pronoun _ce_, which can also mean "this" or "that". Note that _ce_ is invariable, so it can never be _ces sont_.

|  | _Impersonal_ Subject Pronoun | _Personal_ Subject Pronoun |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Singular | c'est | il/elle est |
| Plural | ce sont | ils/elles sont |

These pronouns aren't interchangeable. The basic rule is that you must use _ce_ when _être_ is followed by any determiner—for instance, an article or a possessive adjective\(my, your...\). Note that _c'est_ should be used for singulars and _ce sont_ should be used for plurals.

* C'est un homme. — He's a man. / This is a man. / That is a man.
* Ce sont des chats. — They're cats. / These are cats. / Those are cats.
* C'est la fille. — She is the girl. / This is the girl. / That is the girl.
* Ce sont les femmes. — They are the women. / These are the women. / Those are the women.

  If an adjective, adverb, or both appear after être, then use the personal pronoun.

* Elle est belle. — She is beautiful. \(Or "It is beautiful."\)
* Il est très fort. — He is very strong. \(Or "It is very strong."\)

  As you know, nouns generally need determiners, but one important exception is that professions can act as adjectives after être. This is optional; you can also choose to treat them as nouns.

* He is a doctor. — Il est médecin. / C'est un médecin.

  However, c'est should be used when using an adjective to make a general comment about \(but not describe\) a thing or situation. In this case, use the masculine singular form of the adjective.

* C'est normal ? — Is this normal?
* Non, c'est étrange. — No, this is strange.

## To Be and To Have

**Être** and **avoir** are the most common verbs in French. Like many common verbs, they have irregular conjugations.

There should be a liaison between ils or elles and ont \("il-zon" or "elle-zon"\). The "z" sound is essential here to differentiate between "they are" and "they have", so be sure to emphasize it.

These two verbs are very important because they can act as **auxiliary verbs** in French, but they differ from their English equivalents. "I write" and "I am writing" both translate to j'écris, not je suis écris.

Another important distinction is that avoir means "to have" in the sense of "to possess", but not "to consume" or "to experience". Other verbs must be used for these meanings.

One of the most common idioms in French is the use of the verb avoir in certain places where English would use the verb "to be". This is especially common for states or conditions that a person may experience.

* Elle a chaud. — She is warm. \(Or "She feels warm."\)
* Il a froid. — He is cold.
* Elle a deux ans. — She is two years old.
* J'ai peur ! — I am afraid!

## Continuous Tenses

English has two present tenses: **simple** \("I write"\) and **continuous** \("I am writing"\), but French has no specialized continuous verb tenses. This means that "I write", "I am writing", and "I do write" can translate to j'écris \(not je suis écris\) and vice versa.

However, the idiomatic phrase « être en train de » is often used to indicate that someone is in the process of doing something.

* Je suis en train de manger. — I am \[in the process of\] eating.

When translating, remember that English stative verbs have no continuous forms. For instance, « j'aime un garçon » cannot be translated as "I am loving a boy".
