Now's as good a time as any to form good study habits that will help you on your way through your language journey.

## Notebook

Many find that it helps to keep a notebook where they can write down new vocabulary, grammar, and tricky or important sentences. Even if you never go back to revise what you write, the simple act of putting it on paper will help cement it in your memory.

However, the most important thing is to **practice a little every day**. It can be five minutes or two hours; as long as you stick with it you will be seeing progress.
