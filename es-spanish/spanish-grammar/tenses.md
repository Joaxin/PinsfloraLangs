| **regalar** | Presente | Pretérito Perfecto Compuesto | Pretérito Perfecto Simple |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| yo | regalo | he regalado | regalé |
| tú | regalas | has regalado | regalaste |
| él/ella/usted | regala | ha regalado | regaló |
| nosotros | regalamos | hemos regalado | regalamos |
| vosotros | regaláis | habéis regalado | regalasteis |
| ellos/ustedes | regalan | han regalado | regalaron |

## Present tenses

The Spanish present simple tense is generally formed when you want to talk about a habit or something that happens in general.

For example “I eat rice every night” \(**Como** arroz todas las noches\) or “She believes no-one deserves to live this way” \(Ella **cree** que nadie merece vivir así\).

## Past tenses

The past tense is used when you want to talk about events that happened any time before the present moment, whether that be 2000 years ago, 5 months ago, yesterday, or 2 minutes ago.

However, while in English we get by with only one, in Spanish there are two tenses which are used to express the past, and they have very different uses.

### Past preterite tense

The past preterite is used when you want to talk about specific events that happened at a certain time in the past. For example, “I sold my house,” \(**Vendí** mi casa\) or “the little boy ate a worm” \(El niño se **comió** un gusano\).

Like the present tense, the past preterite is formed by changing the endings of the verb, which will be different depending if the verb ends in -ar, -er, or -ir.

|  | **AR** | **ER** | **IR** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar | comer | abrir |
| yo | \(habl\)é | \(com\)í | \(abr\)í |
| tú | \(habl\)aste | \(com\)iste | \(abr\)iste |
| él/ella | \(habl\)ó | \(com\)ió | \(abr\)ió |
| nosotros | \(habl\)amos | \(com\)imos | \(abr\)imos |
| vosotros | \(habl\)asteis | \(com\)isteis | \(abr\)isteis |
| ellos/ellas | \(habl\)aron | \(com\)ieron | \(abr\)ieron |

**Yo le regalé un juguete.**

I gave him a toy.

### Past imperfect tense

The past imperfect tense is used for speaking about past habitual events, like “I used to eat cereal every day,” \(Yo **comía** cereales todos los días\) or to give background information or set a scene in the past, such as “The door was opening and closing” \(La puerta se **abría** y se **cerraba**\).

In the imperfect tense, the regular -er and -ir endings are exactly the same, so there are only two distinctions.

|  | **AR** | **ER/IR** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar | comer |
| yo | \(habl\)aba | \(com\)ía |
| tú | \(habl\)abas | \(com\)ías |
| él/ella | \(habl\)aba | \(com\)ía |
| nosotros | \(habl\)ábamos | \(com\)íamos |
| vosotros | \(habl\)abais | \(com\)íais |
| ellos/ellas | \(habl\)aban | \(com\)ían |

## Future tenses

The future tense is used to talk about events that **will** happen any time after the present moment. There are two ways to form this in Spanish, which is similar to how we talk about the future in English.

### Future inflection

The future inflection is similar to using the world **will** in English. Instead of changing the endings of the verbs, the future tense takes the whole verb and adds to the end of it. This is therefore a lot easier to remember as there is only one conjugation for all types of verbs.

|  | **AR/ER/IR** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar |
| yo | \(hablar\)é |
| tú | \(hablar\)ás |
| él/ella | \(hablar\)á |
| nosotros | \(hablar\)emos |
| vosotros | \(hablar\)áis |
| ellos/ellas | \(hablar\)án |

### Conditional future/past future

This is essentially the equivalent of the English “would” do something. This could be both in the case of a condition, such as “I would go if you wanted me to” \(Yo iría si tú quisieras\), or when referring to the future from a point in the past, like “She asked me if I would come back” \(Ella me preguntó si yo volvería\).

Only in Spanish, instead of having a separate word to express this \(as we do in English\), this is shown by adding an inflection to the end of the verb, very similar to the future tense.

|  | **AR/ER/IR** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar |
| yo | \(hablar\)ía |
| tú | \(hablar\)ías |
| él/ella | \(hablar\)ía |
| nosotros | \(hablar\)íamos |
| vosotros | \(hablar\)íais |
| ellos/ellas | \(hablar\)ían |

The conditional tense, like the past imperfect, uses the exact same forms for the first and third person, so being clear with who you’re talking about is usually necessary.

## Spanish subjunctive mood

All the previous formations mentioned are in indicative mood, which is named as such because it is indicative of reality. The subjunctive, sometimes referred to as _irrealis_ mood, is used when we talk about something which is uncertain, unknown, or something which is imposed on by something else. There is a whole list of uses for the subjunctive, but you’ll notice that they all follow this same basic notion of surrealism.

### Present subjunctive

By far the most common form of subjunctive, the Spanish present subjunctive expresses the idea of uncertainty or unknown-ness in all present or future situations.

Here are some examples. Note that the subjunctive verb almost always follows the connector ‘que’.

1. When you **don’t think** something is true.

E.g: I don’t think he’s drinking tonight. \| No creo que él **tome** hoy.

1. When you hope something will happen.

E.g: I hope he talks to me. \| Espero que me **hable**.

1. When you talk about the moment something happens in the future.

E.g: When I travel to Uruguay, I’m going to visit all the monuments in the country. \| Cuando **viaje** a Uruguay, voy a conocer todos los monumentos del país.

1. When you don’t have a specific **one** in mind.

E.g: Find a chair that can handle this weight. \| Encuéntrame una silla que **pueda** aguantar este peso.

1. When it’s whatever.

E.g: Do whatever you want. \| Haz lo que tú **quieras**.

1. When you’re imposing something on somebody else.

E.g: I want you to wash the dishes. \| Quiero que **laves** los platos.

1. General well-wishing.

E.g: Hope you find a new job soon! \| ¡Que encuentres un nuevo trabajo pronto!

\(Note that here, you could add ‘espero’ but the sentence also works fine without it.\)

These are just the instances I could think of off the top of my head, but there are many more scenarios in which the present subjunctive could be used, so keep that in mind and do some more research if you really want to master the subjunctive.

For the conjugation of the subjunctive, you’ll notice that the endings are almost opposites of the regular present tense endings.

### Spanish present subjunctive regular verb chart:

|  | **AR** | **ER/IR** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar | comer |
| yo | \(habl\)e | \(com\)a |
| tú | \(habl\)es | \(com\)as |
| él/ella | \(habl\)e | \(com\)a |
| nosotros | \(habl\)emos | \(com\)amos |
| vosotros | \(habl\)éis | \(com\)áis |
| ellos/ellas | \(habl\)en | \(com\)an |

Once again, be careful with the first and third person formations as they are identical. Make it clear who you are talking about.

## Past subjunctive

The past subjunctive is basically used in the same way as the present one, but when you are talking about instances in the past. Taking some of the above examples, we can put them in the past tense and employ the past subjunctive instead.

**For example:**

If you want to say, “I hoped he would talk to me,”:

Espero que él me **hable** → Yo esperaba que él me **hablara**.

If you want to say, “I wanted you to wash the dishes,”:

Quiero que **laves** los platos → Yo quería que **lavaras** los platos.

At first glance, past subjunctive might seem like the most complicated Spanish tense, but it’s actually quite simple. To form the past subjunctive, you should take the third person plural form of the verb in past preterite, take away -on, and then add the same endings we see in the present subjunctive of ER/IR verbs. You’ll find that there are absolutely **no exceptions** to this rule – it even works with irregular verbs.

Let’s take a look at how this plays out:

|  | **AR** | **ER/IR** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar | comer |
| Past preterite third person plural form | **hablar**on | **comier**on |
| yo | \(hablar\)a | \(comier\)a |
| tú | \(hablar\)as | \(comier\)as |
| él/ella | \(hablar\)a | \(comier\)a |
| nosotros | \(hablár\)amos | \(comiér\)amos |
| vosotros | \(hablar\)eis | \(comoer\)ais |
| ellos/ellas | \(hablar\)an | \(comier\)an |

There are two ways to form the past subjunctive which are completely interchangeable. Which one is used generally just depends on the region. The other one is the same for all 3 verb endings, and looks like this:

|  | **AR** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Example verb | hablar |
| Past preterite third person plural form | **habla**ron |
| yo | \(habla\)se |
| tú | \(habla\)ses |
| él/ella | \(habla\)se |
| nosotros | \(hablá\)semos |
| vosotros | \(habla\)seis |
| ellos/ellas | \(habla\)sen |
