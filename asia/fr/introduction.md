# Introduction

### Genders

French has two grammatical genders: **masculine** and **feminine**.

All nouns have a gender that you must memorize.

**e.g.**

Le garçon **/** la fille

L'homme **/** La femme **/** L'enfant \( child can be a boy or a girl\)

La pomme **/** La orange

la bière \(beer\)

la lettre \(letter, alphabet\) **/** le lettre \(letter\)

le café

le menu

le français

Le Petit Prince

### Articles

```text
**Articles** (e.g. "the" or "a") provide context for a noun. In English, articles may be omitted, but French nouns almost always have an article.
​
 French has three types of articles: 
```

* **Definite articles** \(the\) : nouns that are known to the speakers / the general sense of a noun
* **Indefinite articles** \(a/an/one\) : countable nouns that are unspecified or unknown to the speakers
* **Partitive articles** \(some/any\) : quantity of something uncountable

| Article | Masculine | Feminine | Plural | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Definite | le/l' | la/l' | les | **le** _chat_ — the cat |
| Indefinite | un | une | des | **une** _femme_ — a woman |
| Partitive | du/de l' | de la/de l' |  | **de l**'eau— \(some\) water |

### Personal Subject Pronouns

The **subject** is the person or thing that performs an action or is being described.

This is often a noun, but a **personal subject pronoun**\(e.g. "I", "you", or "he"\).

Notice above that the verb **manger** \(as well as its English equivalent, "to eat"\) changes form to agree grammatically with the subject. These forms are called **conjugations** of that verb.

| subject | _Être_ \(To Be\) | _Manger_ \(To Eat\) | _Avoir_ \(To Have\) | Parler\(To Speak\) | Lire\(To Read\) | écrire\(To Write\) | Boire \(To Drink\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| je | suis | mange | \(j'\)ai | parle | lis | \(j'\)écris | bois |
| tu/vous | es | manges | as | parles | lis | écris | bois |
| il/elle/on | est | mange | a | parle | lit | écrit | boit |
| nous | sommes | mangeons | avons | parlons | lisons | écrivons | buvons |
| vous | êtes | mangez | avez | parlez | lisez | écrivez | buvez |
| ils/elles | sont | mangent | ont | parlent | lisent | écrivent | biovent |

### Elisions

_Le_ and _la_ become just **l'** if they're followed by a `vowel sound`. This is an example of **elision**, which is the removal of a vowel sound in order to prevent consecutive vowel sounds and make pronunciation easier.

Elisions are mandatory—for instance, _je aime_ is incorrect. It must be _j'aime_. These other one-syllable words can also elide: _**je**_**,** _**me**_**,** _**te**_**,** _**se**_**,** _**de**_**,** _**ce**_**,** _**ne**_**, and** _**que**_**.**

_Tu_ can also be elided in casual speech, but not in writing.

### Contractions

```text
In a **contraction**, two words combine to form one shortened word. For instance, the partitive article *du* is a contraction of the preposition *de* with *le*. 
```

* _du pain_ — \(some\) bread

  However, since _du_ can create vowel conflicts, when it would appear in front of a `vowel sound`, it takes the elided _de l'_ form instead. This is also the case for _de la_.

* _de l'**a**nanas_ \[masc.\] — \(some\) pineapple
* _de l'**e**au_ \[fem.\] — \(some\) water

### Words Beginning with H

The letter H is always mute \(silent\) in French, but when H starts a word, it can act as a consonant \(aspirate\) or vowel \(non-aspirate\). For example, the H in _homme_ acts as a vowel. This means that "the man" must be written as _l'homme_.

Conversely, an aspirate H doesn't participate in elisions or liaisons. It's usually found at the beginning of loanwords from German or other languages. For instance, "the hero" is _le héros_.

### Plurals

```text
Many French words have plural forms. Plural nouns and adjectives can be formed by appending an *-s* to the singular, but remember that this *-s* is usually silent.
```

* _homme_ \("man"\) ⇒ _hommes_ \("men"\)
* _femme_ \("woman"\) ⇒ _femmes_ \("women"\)
* _chat noir_ \("black cat"\) ⇒ _chats noirs_ \("black cats"\)

  Pronouns, adjectives, and articles must agree with their nouns in both gender and number. Consider the examples below and note how the article and adjective change to agree with each noun.

* Masculine singular: _Le chat noir_ — The black cat
* Masculine plural: _Les chats noirs_ — The black cats
* Feminine singular: _La robe noire_ — The black dress
* Feminine plural: _Les robes noires_ — The black dresses

**Notes** : Not all adjectives change forms. For instance, _riche_ is the same for both masculine and feminine singular nouns.

### _Tu_ or _Vous_?

French has two words for the subject pronoun "you": **tu** and **vous**. For a singular "you", _tu_ should only be used for friends, peers, relatives, children, or anyone else who's very familiar to you.

In all other cases and also for plurals, the more polite _vous_ should be used to show respect. When in doubt, use _vous_.

### Gallicism

`A gallicism is a phrase or grammatical construction peculiar to the French language`

When describing people and things with a noun after _être_ in French, you usually can't use the personal subject pronoun like _il_, _elle_, _ils_, and _elles_. Instead, you must use the impersonal pronoun _ce_, which can also mean "this" or "that". Note that _ce_ is invariable, so it can never be _ces sont_.

|  | _Impersonal_ Subject Pronoun | _Personal_ Subject Pronoun |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Singular | c'est | il/elle est |
| Plural | ce sont | ils/elles sont |

These pronouns aren't interchangeable. The basic rule is that you must use _ce_ when _être_ is followed by any determiner—for instance, an article or a possessive adjective\(my, your...\). Note that _c'est_ should be used for singulars and _ce sont_ should be used for plurals.

* _C'est \*_un_\* homme._ — He's a man. / This is a man. / That is a man.
* _Ce sont \*_des_\* chats._ — They're cats. / These are cats. / Those are cats.
* _C'est \*_la_\* fille._ — She is the girl. / This is the girl. / That is the girl.
* _Ce sont \*_les_\* femmes._ — They are the women. / These are the women. / Those are the women.

  If an adjective, adverb, or both appear after _être_, then use the personal pronoun.

* _Elle est belle_. — She is beautiful. \(Or "It is beautiful."\)
* _Il est très fort._ — He is very strong. \(Or "It is very strong."\)

  As you know, nouns generally need determiners, but one important exception is that professions can act as adjectives after _être_. This is optional; you can also choose to treat them as nouns.

* He is a doctor. — _Il est médecin._ / _C'est \*_un_\* médecin._

  However, _c'est_ should be used when using an adjective to make a general comment about \(but not describe\) a thing or situation. In this case, use the masculine singular form of the adjective.

* _C'est normal ?_ — Is this normal?
* _Non, c'est étrange._ — No, this is strange.

### To Be and To Have

_Être_ and _avoir_ are the most common verbs in French. Like many common verbs, they have irregular conjugations.

There should be a liaison between _ils_ or _elles_ and _ont_ \("il-zon" or "elle-zon"\). The "z" sound is essential here to differentiate between "they are" and "they have", so be sure to emphasize it.

These two verbs are very important because they can act as **auxiliary verbs** in French, but they differ from their English equivalents. "I write" and "I am writing" both translate to _j'écris_, not _je suis écris_.

Another important distinction is that _avoir_ means "to have" in the sense of "to possess", but not "to consume" or "to experience". Other verbs must be used for these meanings.

One of the most common idioms in French is the use of the verb _avoir_ in certain places where English would use the verb "to be". This is especially common for states or conditions that a person may experience.

* _Elle a chaud._ — She is warm. \(Or "She feels warm."\)
* _Il a froid._ — He is cold.
* _Elle a deux ans._ — She is two years old.
* _J'ai peur !_ — I am afraid!

### Continuous Tenses

English has two present tenses: **simple** \("I write"\) and **continuous** \("I am writing"\), but French has no specialized continuous verb tenses. This means that "I write", "I am writing", and "I do write" can translate to _j'écris_ \(not _je suis écris_\) and vice versa.

However, the idiomatic phrase _« être en train de »_ is often used to indicate that someone is in the process of doing something.

* _Je suis en train de manger._ — I am \[in the process of\] eating.

  When translating, remember that English stative verbs have no continuous forms. For instance, _« j'aime un garçon »_ cannot be translated as "I am loving a boy".
