# Introduction

Welcome to the Portuguese course :D

In these basic lessons, you are going to see some words for people, such as man, woman, boy and girl, and also some basic verbs for eating, drinking, etc.

The two first things you will notice is that:

**1 - Personal pronouns may be omitted**, especially when the verb conjugation is unique for that pronoun.

* **I** am a man = **\(Eu\)** sou um homem

In the sentence above, "eu" is totally optional. The verb "sou" is unique for the "eu" pronoun, and it already reveals who the subject is. \(Later you will learn how to conjugate verbs for each person\)

**2 - Portuguese nouns have genders**, even when they are not human!

Not only people and animals are gendered in Portuguese, but virtually all things are.

For instance, "maçã \(apple\)" is a feminine word, and "carro \(car\)" is masculine.

**THE INDEFINITE ARTICLES "UM" AND "UMA"**

Along with nouns, articles also have genders. They follow the gender of the noun they refer to. The masculine article is "um" and the feminine one is "uma":

**Masculine:**

* Um menino = a boy
* Um carro = a car

**Feminine:**

* Uma menina = a girl
* Uma maçã = an apple

**But how can one tell the gender of a word?**

Some words tell their gender by their ending. See "menin**o**" and "menin**a**", for instance. They are a type of word that can change its ending based on gender. These will often end in "o" for masculine and "a" for feminine.

There are other typical endings that can show a word's gender, but they are part of further skills :\)

And, unfortunately, many words simply don't follow any pattern, and their gender just have to be memorised.

**Um menino e uma menina** a boy and agirl

**Um homem** a man

**Uma mulher** a woman

**Sou mulher/ Eu sou uma mulher** I am a woman

**Eu tenho um carro.** I have a car.

**Tenho uma casa.** I have a house.

**maçã** Apple

**Pão e leite.** Bread and milk.

**Eu bebo água.** I drink waterItalian

so the days of the week in Portuguese are:

**Segunda-feira** [say-goon-dah fay-ee-rah] - Monday.

**Terça-feira** [tayr-sah fay-ee-rah] - Tuesday.

**Quarta-feira** [kwar-tah fay-ee-rah] - Wednesday.

**Quinta-feira** [keen-tah fay-ee-rah] - Thursday.

**Sexta-feira** [say-eesh-tah fay-ee-rah] - Friday

**Sábado** [sah-bah-doo] - Saturday.

**Domingo** [doo-meen-goo] - Sunday.

So, as we can see, **Segunda-feira** means "second fair", **Terça-feira** "third fair", **Quarta-feira** "fourth fair", and so on.

OK, now you might wondering... Why is Monday the second fair and not the first?

That's because the first day is "God's day" - Domingo - from the Latin *"domini"*, or God's day.

So, under the Portuguese culture, the first day of the week should be given to God as the creator of the universe.

This is particularly interesting because it not only shows that Portugal is a monotheist country, but also shows the Portuguese tenacity and flair for commerce and trade.

In day-to-day conversations, people normally drop the word "feira", because it's understood that "segunda" means "segunda-feira".

Therefore, it is often noticed people saying things like:

"Na terça vou à praia" - On Tuesday, I'm going to the beach.

"Sabado" - Saturday - on it's turn, refers to Sabbath" believed to have an origin from the Jewish.

It's also quite likely to see the Portuguese days of the week abbreviated (when written on a poster hanging on the shop doors indicating the opening hours) like this:

**Segunda-feira - 2ª.**

**Terça-feira - 3ª.**

**Quarta-feira - 4ª.**

**Quinta-feira - 5ª.**

**Sexta-feira - 6ª.**

**Sábado - Sab.**

**Domingo - Dom.**
