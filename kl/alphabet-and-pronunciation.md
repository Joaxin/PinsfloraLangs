# Alphabet&Pronunciation

## **Pronunciation**

**QumwI' yIchu'!** \("Activate communicator!"\)

We're excited to bring the language of the future to your primitive technical devices!

Much as the English letter "H" is "aitch" or "haitch", or "Y" is "wye" & "W" is "double-you", Klingon letters also have names.

The vowels are called **'at 'et 'It 'ot 'ut**. The consonants add **-ay** to the consonant sound, e.g. **m** is called **may** \(sounds like English _my_\) & **tlh** is **tlhay**. Translate those as "the letter a", "the letter m", "the letter tlh", etc.

### Alphabet

The Klingon alphabet is: **a b ch D e gh H I j l m n ng o p q Q r S t tlh u v w y '**

Note that case matters: many letters are _always_ lowercase \(even at the beginning of a sentence\) & some are _always_ uppercase.

Note **I** \(capital i\) versus **l** \(small L\) - the second has a small curl at the bottom in Duolingo's website font. The vowel **I** never has an adjacent vowel. The consonant **l** will always have at least one adjacent vowel. **Q** & **q** are two separate letters. **ch gh ng** & **tlh** count as single consonants in Klingon. The **'** \(apostrophe\) also counts as a letter.

### Pronunciation:

Letters **b l m n p t** & **v** are said as in English, but **b, p** & **t** should always have a puff of air, even at the end of a word.

Vowels each have one pronunciation.

'at: **a** as in father 'et: **e** as in ten 'lt: **I** as in it 'ot: **o** as in bowl 'ut: **u** as the oo in pool

**I** is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels we often see in foreign languages.

**w** & **y** are as in English at the beginnings of syllables. At the ends they form a combined sound called a diphthong. At the end of a syllable **w** sounds like **oo** & **y** sounds like "ee". So **paw** sounds like "pow" & **pay** sounds like "pie".

**ch** is said as in "church". Never like an English "k" or "sh", & never like a German, Scottish, or Hebrew "ch". Please note that **ch** is a single Klingon consonant.

**j** should be said hard like the beginning & end of the English word "judge". Never with the softer sound from French.

**r** is not usually said at the roof of the mouth like an American English "r", but with the tip of the tongue behind the teeth like a Spanish "r".

**q** sounds much like an English "k", but from the back of the throat. The **q** does not include the "w" sound as in English words that begin with "qu". Even when **q** is followed by **u**, the two sounds do not blend. The Klingon word **qul** \("fire"\) sounds like the English word "cool", but with a stronger "c" sound. This is a different letter than **Q** explained below.

**D** in Klingon sounds similar to the English "d", but said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth & is capitalized to help us remember the difference.

**S** is similarly said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth. It winds up sounding a bit like an English "sh", but should never be said like an "sh". The **S** is also capitalized to help us remember the difference.

**ng** is said exactly as in English, but English speakers are not used to it at the beginning of a word. Put the rear of your tongue to the roof of your mouth to make this sound. Please note that **ng** is a single Klingon consonant.

**gh** is produced at the top of the throat with a raspy gargle or purr & a voiced vibration in the throat. Please note that **gh** is a single Klingon consonant.

**H** is said in the same position as **gh** but without the voiced vibration. It is similar to the "ch" heard in Scottish "loch", Hebrew "l'chaim", & German "Bach", though it is usually said a little further back & a little stronger than those sounds. It is capitalized to remind us not to say it like the weak English "h". When you see a lower-case "h" it will always be part of one of the consonants **ch**, **gh**, or **tlh**.

**Q** combines the **q** sound & the **H** sound. It should start with the throat closed like you are going to make a **q**, but then explode into a raspy **H**-type sound.

**tlh** is another sound not made in English. It explodes like a "t", but out the sides of the tongue like an "l". Note that this is one consonant in Klingon & is the only time you will see a l \(lower-case L\) without at least one vowel next to it.

**'** marks a sound we do make in English. We don't usually mark it in English. In Klingon it is a full letter & leaving it out is like missing any other letter from a word. We call this **qaghwI'**. It is made by closing the throat & is called a glottal stop. It's the stop between syllables in the word "uh-oh". You may notice that you also close the throat at the beginning of "uh-oh" and all English words that start with a vowel. Klingon **'ej** sounds exactly like English "edge".
