# Introduction

We would like to tell you "Hello and welcome" in Klingon, but as you will see, Klingon does not have equivalents to those words. Klingons tend to be very direct and rarely engage in conversation simply for the pleasure of conversing, making superfluous many of the pleasantries we are accustomed to using in English.

In this unit we will focus on getting you using Klingon right away by introducing useful phrases that you can memorize. The grammar for these phrases will be explained in future lessons.

In case you skipped the Sounds unit to dive right in, following are some important notes:

Case matters! Many letters are **always** lowercase \(even at the beginning of a sentence!\) and some are **always** uppercase.

Pay attention to **I** \(capital i\) versus **l** \(small L\) - the second has a small curl at the bottom in Duolingo's website font.

## nuqneH & nuqjatlh

**nuqneH** is a truncated form of **nuq DaneH**, meaning "What do you want?"

It is a common misconception that this is "the Klingon word for hello". In fact, Klingons have no word for hello. If a Klingon wishes to say something, they'll walk up to you and say it, without wasting time - as they see it - on idle chatter.

**nuqjatlh?** is a truncated form of **nuq Dajatlh?**, meaning "What did you say?"

These phrases are special exclamations and not grammatically formed questions.

## Qapla'

Klingon for "success".

This word is often mistranslated as "Goodbye", due to the fact that it is often heard at the end of conversations. In fact, Klingon has no word for "Goodbye", but **Qapla'** is often used either to congratulate somebody on their success or to wish them success in the future.

## Video

Quvar - also known as the Klingon Teacher from Germany - has produced an informative video about the words **nuqneH** and **Qapla'**, available in both [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqS6FR_RDE) and [German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt43a9uIYQ8).

## Verbs

Klingon verbs do not have tense \(past, present, future\), so a verb such as **yaj** could mean "understands, understood, will understand".

They do have aspect \(e.g. whether an action is completed or is continuous\), but that will come later in the course. For now, translate verbs as non-continuous forms \(e.g. "he walks" or "he walked" - not "he is walking" or "he was walking"\) until the continuous aspect is introduced.

In grammar, a _subject_ is the one doing the action and an _object_ is the one the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the _subject_ and the _object_ of verbs by means of _prefixes_.

The most important verb prefixes at the beginning of the course are:

* jI- = I \(subject\), no object
* bI- = you \(subject\), no object -- for one person
* vI- = I \(subject\), him/her/it/them \(object\)
* Da- = you \(subject\), him/her/it/them \(object\) -- for one person

If the subject is third person \(he/she/it/they\) and has either no object or a third-person object \(him/her/it/them\), then the verb has no prefix. \(With the exception of "they - him/her/it", which you will learn later\). So a verb such as **yaj** can mean "he understands; she understands; it understands; they understand; he understands him/her/it/them; she understands him/her/it/them; they understand them", or the same in the past or future.

Because of the verbal prefixes, the subject and/or object does not have to be included as a pronoun, and subject or object pronouns are often left off.

## Torg and Mara

In this unit, you will meet Torg and Mara. They will appear in many sentences where a name is useful. \(Later on, more names will appear.\)

Torg is male and Mara is female - though that fact is not important to Klingon grammar, as there are no separate words for "he" and "she", and no different verb prefixes or suffixes depending on gender.

## Joining nouns with and without "and"

Nouns are joined with **je**, which comes _after_ the nouns, as in **torgh mara je** "Torg and Mara", or **Hol pong je** "the language and the name".

If there is no **je** after nouns next to each other, the effect is similar to possession: **mara pong** "Mara's name"; **tlhIngan Hol** "a Klingon's language, the Klingon language".

## Word order

Klingon word order in a sentence may seem like the opposite of English word order - first comes the object \(if any\), then the verb, then the subject. So a sentence such as **mara legh torgh** means "Torg sees Mara".
