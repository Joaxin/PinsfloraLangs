# Introduction

We would like to tell you "Hello and welcome" in Klingon, but as you will see, Klingon does not have equivalents to those words. Klingons tend to be very direct and rarely engage in conversation simply for the pleasure of conversing, making superfluous many of the pleasantries we are accustomed to using in English.

In this unit we will focus on getting you using Klingon right away by introducing useful phrases that you can memorize. The grammar for these phrases will be explained in future lessons.

In case you skipped the Sounds unit to dive right in, following are some important notes:

Case matters! Many letters are **always** lowercase \(even at the beginning of a sentence!\) and some are **always** uppercase.

Pay attention to **I** \(capital i\) versus **l** \(small L\) - the second has a small curl at the bottom in Duolingo's website font.

## nuqneH & nuqjatlh

**nuqneH** is a truncated form of **nuq DaneH**, meaning "What do you want?"

It is a common misconception that this is "the Klingon word for hello". In fact, Klingons have no word for hello. If a Klingon wishes to say something, they'll walk up to you and say it, without wasting time - as they see it - on idle chatter.

**nuqjatlh?** is a truncated form of **nuq Dajatlh?**, meaning "What did you say?"

These phrases are special exclamations and not grammatically formed questions.

## Qapla'

Klingon for "success".

This word is often mistranslated as "Goodbye", due to the fact that it is often heard at the end of conversations. In fact, Klingon has no word for "Goodbye", but **Qapla'** is often used either to congratulate somebody on their success or to wish them success in the future.

## Video

Quvar - also known as the Klingon Teacher from Germany - has produced an informative video about the words **nuqneH** and **Qapla'**, available in both [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auqS6FR_RDE) and [German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt43a9uIYQ8).

## Verbs

Klingon verbs do not have tense \(past, present, future\), so a verb such as **yaj** could mean "understands, understood, will understand".

They do have aspect \(e.g. whether an action is completed or is continuous\), but that will come later in the course. For now, translate verbs as non-continuous forms \(e.g. "he walks" or "he walked" - not "he is walking" or "he was walking"\) until the continuous aspect is introduced.

In grammar, a _subject_ is the one doing the action and an _object_ is the one the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the _subject_ and the _object_ of verbs by means of _prefixes_.

The most important verb prefixes at the beginning of the course are:

* jI- = I \(subject\), no object
* bI- = you \(subject\), no object -- for one person
* vI- = I \(subject\), him/her/it/them \(object\)
* Da- = you \(subject\), him/her/it/them \(object\) -- for one person

If the subject is third person \(he/she/it/they\) and has either no object or a third-person object \(him/her/it/them\), then the verb has no prefix. \(With the exception of "they - him/her/it", which you will learn later\). So a verb such as **yaj** can mean "he understands; she understands; it understands; they understand; he understands him/her/it/them; she understands him/her/it/them; they understand them", or the same in the past or future.

Because of the verbal prefixes, the subject and/or object does not have to be included as a pronoun, and subject or object pronouns are often left off.

## Torg and Mara

In this unit, you will meet Torg and Mara. They will appear in many sentences where a name is useful. \(Later on, more names will appear.\)

Torg is male and Mara is female - though that fact is not important to Klingon grammar, as there are no separate words for "he" and "she", and no different verb prefixes or suffixes depending on gender.

## Joining nouns with and without "and"

Nouns are joined with **je**, which comes _after_ the nouns, as in **torgh mara je** "Torg and Mara", or **Hol pong je** "the language and the name".

If there is no **je** after nouns next to each other, the effect is similar to possession: **mara pong** "Mara's name"; **tlhIngan Hol** "a Klingon's language, the Klingon language".

## Word order

Klingon word order in a sentence may seem like the opposite of English word order - first comes the object \(if any\), then the verb, then the subject. So a sentence such as **mara legh torgh** means "Torg sees Mara".

## **Pronunciation**

**QumwI' yIchu'!** \("Activate communicator!"\)

We're excited to bring the language of the future to your primitive technical devices!

Much as the English letter "H" is "aitch" or "haitch", or "Y" is "wye" & "W" is "double-you", Klingon letters also have names.

The vowels are called **'at 'et 'It 'ot 'ut**. The consonants add **-ay** to the consonant sound, e.g. **m** is called **may** \(sounds like English _my_\) & **tlh** is **tlhay**. Translate those as "the letter a", "the letter m", "the letter tlh", etc.

### Alphabet

The Klingon alphabet is: **a b ch D e gh H I j l m n ng o p q Q r S t tlh u v w y '**

Note that case matters: many letters are _always_ lowercase \(even at the beginning of a sentence\) & some are _always_ uppercase.

Note **I** \(capital i\) versus **l** \(small L\) - the second has a small curl at the bottom in Duolingo's website font. The vowel **I** never has an adjacent vowel. The consonant **l** will always have at least one adjacent vowel. **Q** & **q** are two separate letters. **ch gh ng** & **tlh** count as single consonants in Klingon. The **'** \(apostrophe\) also counts as a letter.

### Pronunciation:

Letters **b l m n p t** & **v** are said as in English, but **b, p** & **t** should always have a puff of air, even at the end of a word.

Vowels each have one pronunciation.

'at: **a** as in father 'et: **e** as in ten 'lt: **I** as in it 'ot: **o** as in bowl 'ut: **u** as the oo in pool

**I** is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels we often see in foreign languages.

**w** & **y** are as in English at the beginnings of syllables. At the ends they form a combined sound called a diphthong. At the end of a syllable **w** sounds like **oo** & **y** sounds like "ee". So **paw** sounds like "pow" & **pay** sounds like "pie".

**ch** is said as in "church". Never like an English "k" or "sh", & never like a German, Scottish, or Hebrew "ch". Please note that **ch** is a single Klingon consonant.

**j** should be said hard like the beginning & end of the English word "judge". Never with the softer sound from French.

**r** is not usually said at the roof of the mouth like an American English "r", but with the tip of the tongue behind the teeth like a Spanish "r".

**q** sounds much like an English "k", but from the back of the throat. The **q** does not include the "w" sound as in English words that begin with "qu". Even when **q** is followed by **u**, the two sounds do not blend. The Klingon word **qul** \("fire"\) sounds like the English word "cool", but with a stronger "c" sound. This is a different letter than **Q** explained below.

**D** in Klingon sounds similar to the English "d", but said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth & is capitalized to help us remember the difference.

**S** is similarly said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth. It winds up sounding a bit like an English "sh", but should never be said like an "sh". The **S** is also capitalized to help us remember the difference.

**ng** is said exactly as in English, but English speakers are not used to it at the beginning of a word. Put the rear of your tongue to the roof of your mouth to make this sound. Please note that **ng** is a single Klingon consonant.

**gh** is produced at the top of the throat with a raspy gargle or purr & a voiced vibration in the throat. Please note that **gh** is a single Klingon consonant.

**H** is said in the same position as **gh** but without the voiced vibration. It is similar to the "ch" heard in Scottish "loch", Hebrew "l'chaim", & German "Bach", though it is usually said a little further back & a little stronger than those sounds. It is capitalized to remind us not to say it like the weak English "h". When you see a lower-case "h" it will always be part of one of the consonants **ch**, **gh**, or **tlh**.

**Q** combines the **q** sound & the **H** sound. It should start with the throat closed like you are going to make a **q**, but then explode into a raspy **H**-type sound.

**tlh** is another sound not made in English. It explodes like a "t", but out the sides of the tongue like an "l". Note that this is one consonant in Klingon & is the only time you will see a l \(lower-case L\) without at least one vowel next to it.

**'** marks a sound we do make in English. We don't usually mark it in English. In Klingon it is a full letter & leaving it out is like missing any other letter from a word. We call this **qaghwI'**. It is made by closing the throat & is called a glottal stop. It's the stop between syllables in the word "uh-oh". You may notice that you also close the throat at the beginning of "uh-oh" and all English words that start with a vowel. Klingon **'ej** sounds exactly like English "edge".
