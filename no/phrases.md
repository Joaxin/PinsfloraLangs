# Phrases

I hope you've been enjoying your Norwegian learning thus far. There are a lot of new things to take on board in these early skills, but don't worry if everything doesn't stick right away; you're going to get plenty of revision of the basic concepts as you move through the course.

## Greetings

Below is a list of common greetings in the Norwegian language, for your reference.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hei** | _Hi_ |
| **Hallo** | _Hello_ |
| **God dag** | Good day; Good afternoon |
| **God morgen**\(en\) | Good morning |
| **God kveld**\(en\) | Good evening |
| **God natt**\(en,ei\) | Good night |
| **God helg**\(en,ei\) | Good weekend |

## Languages and Nationalities

In Norwegian, most names of languages are derived from the name of the country, the adjective or the nationality with the ending **–sk** at the end. Below are a few examples.

| Country | Adjective | Nationality | Language |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Norge** - _Norway_ | **norsk** - _Norwegian_ | **en nordmann** - _a Norwegian_ | **norsk** - _Norwegian \(language\)_ |
| **England** - _England_ | **engelsk** - _English_ | **en engelskmann** - _an Englishman_ | **engelsk** - _English \(language\)_ |
| **Frankrike** - _France_ | **fransk** - _French_ | **en franskmann** - _a Frenchman_ | **fransk** - _French \(language\)_ |

As you may have noticed above, Norwegians do not capitalize adjectives, nationalities or languages, only countries. All words are capitalized if they come at the beginning of the sentence, just like in English.

## Who? What? Where?

When you're just starting out learning a new language, few things are more useful than to be able to ask the questions that allow you to find what you need or further your learning.

Confused yet? We have just the word for you...

**Hva** is the word for _what_, and also happens to be just the right thing to exclaim when you feel like you've been hit in the head with one Norwegian grammar rule too many.

We've compiled a list of common phrases in the Norwegian language, for your reference.

Many of them are idiomatic, meaning that they don't translate word for word to English. You'll have to learn the entire phrase.

One example is "**Ha det bra!**", which literally means "Have it good!", but idiomatically translates to "Goodbye!"

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hvordan har du det?** | How are you? |
| **Hvordan går det?** | How is it going? |
| **Bare bra, takk!** | Just fine, thanks! |
| **Bare hyggelig!** | You are welcome |
| **Tusen Takk!** | Thank you very much! |
| **Jeg har det bra.** | I'm doing well. |
| **Ha det bra!** | Goodbye! |
| **Vi ses!** | See you later! |
| **unnskyld** | sorry, excuse me, pardon |
| **vær så snill** | please, be so kind |
| **Hva har hun?** | What does she have? |
| **Der er dere!** | There you are! |
| **God helg og god tur!** | Have a nice weekend and a nice trip! |
| **Ha en hyggelig dag!** | Have a nice day |

## Knowing

The verb **å vite**, _to know_, is an irregular verb in Norwegian. Its present tense, which you will familiarize yourself with in this skill, is **vet**. See that vowel change from the infinitive to the present? Cheeky!

There are actually several verbs for knowing, and you'll get to know them all in due time, but this particular one deals with factual knowledge. Some examples of that is knowing what or where something is, or knowing something about something or someone.

> **Vet du hvor det er?** Do you know where it is?
>
> **Vet du hvem hun er?** Do you know who she is?
>
> **Hva vet han?**
>
> What does he know?

## Words

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **bor** | lives |
| **heter** | is named |
| **kanskje** | maybe, perhaps |
