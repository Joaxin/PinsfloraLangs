# Animals\(no\)

Many animal names in Norwegian share etymological ties with English ones, but the meaning has drifted over time in one direction or another. Below are some examples.

**Beware these false friends!**

| Norwegian |  | Translation | Related Word |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **hund** | hunden | dog | hound |
| **fugl** | fuglen | bird | fowl |
| **elg** | elgen | moose | elk\* |
| **et dyr** | dyret | animal | deer |

\*In British English, "elg" and "elk" are actual cognates. In American English, "elk" refers to a different animal.

The following words are true friends, meaning that the words are similar in both spelling and meaning.

> Grammatical and Biological Gender

After being introduced to nouns such as **ei jente**, **en gutt**, and **et barn**, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there was a correlation between a word's grammatical gender and it's biological gender, or sex.

However, this is not the case. Grammatical gender is a completely independent concept. While **en hund/hunden** is a _masculine_ noun, that does not imply that the dog we're referring to is male, that's just the grammatical gender of the word itself.

**Katter, hunder og hester er dyr.**

Cats, dogs and horses are animals.
