# Introduction

> A heartfelt welcome

Norwegian is a language with `simpler grammar` than many other European languages, but it is still a gendered language with three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine and neuter.

### Grammatical Gender

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| en mann | en/ei kvinne | et barn |
| en gutt | en/ei jente | et brev |
| en meny | en/ei hytte \(cabin\) | et smørbrød |
| en bok |  | et eple |
| en katt |  | et brød |
| en avis |  | et vann |
| en sykkel |  |  |

> All feminine gendered nouns can be classified as **masculine gender** as well. In theory, one could treat all feminine nouns as masculine ones, but most Norwegians still use the feminine form, especially for certain words.

The choice really is up to you! Both **en kvinne** and **ei kvinne** are grammatically correct, and the tendency to use the feminine gender depends on geography and dialect. We have decided to teach it where it is most natural to use it, with words such as **en jente** meaning _girl_, for example.

### Pronouns & Conjugation

Norwegian pronouns are very straightforward and correspond well to English ones:

| Singular |  | Plural |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **jeg** | I | **vi** | we |
| **du** | you, _singular_ | **dere** | you, _plural_ |
| **han**, **hun**, **det** | he, she, it | **de** | they |

As in English, the pronouns above only pertain to subjects. The pronouns at the receiving end of a verb, in other words the _object pronouns_, are as follows:

| Singular |  | Plural |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **meg** | me | **oss** | us |
| **deg** | you \(singular\) | **dere** | you \(plural\) |
| **ham**, **henne**, **det/den** | him, her, it | **dem** | them |

> **Han** is an alternative form of **ham**, but in this course we will use "han" exclusively as a subject \("he"\), and "ham" for the object form \("him"\).

Conjugation couldn't be simpler. All conjugated verbs have an `-r stem` in the present, and verbs don't change according to the subject! How easy is that?

| Singular |  | Plural |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **jeg er** | I am | **vi er** | we are |
| **du er** | you are | **dere er** | you are |
| **han**, **hun**, **det er** | he, she, it is | **de er** | they are |

> Although not as common as **det**, **den** is used to mean _it_ or _that_ when referring to a masculine or feminine subject, and not a neuter one. **Det** is used to mean _it_ or _that_ when referring back to a neuter subject, and when introducing a brand new noun that has not yet been mentioned - regardless of the gender of that noun.
>
> Den is for hankjønn \[masculine\] \(article en\) and hunkjønn \[feminine\] \(article ei\)
>
> Det is for intetkjønn \["Ungendered"\] \(article et\) or used when the gender of someone has not been introduced or is not known.

| eat | read | speak | see |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| spiser | leser | snakker | ser |
| **drink** | **buy** | **sits** | **hear** |
| drikker | kjøper | sitter | hører |
| **viser** |  |  |  |
| show |  |  |  |

### Pronunciation

As a general rule, words are spelled as they're pronounced in Norwegian. One exception is words beginning with **hv**, such as **hva**, meaning _what_. In this word, the **h** is silent.

In addition, there are several letters and letter combinations that are pronounced differently from English.

| Norweg. | IPA, Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| A | \[ɑ\], very open |
| B | \[b\] |
| C | \[s\] or \[k\] depending on word, very rare |
| D | \[d\], silent in consonant clusters |
| E | \[e\] or \[ɛ\], \[æ\] in _her_ and _der_, \[i\] in _de_ |
| F | \[f\] |
| G | \[g\], \[j\] before an i; silent before a j; silent after an i and sometimes an a or o |
| H | \[h\], silent before v |
| I | \[i\] like the _e_ in _email_ or _ebook_, \[ɪ\] before two consonants |
| J | \[j\], like the _y_ in _yes_ or _yellow_ |
| K | \[k\] |
| kj, ki, ky | \[ç\], like the sharp _h_ in _human_ |
| L | \[l\] |
| M | \[m\] |
| N | \[n\] |
| O | \[u\] like the _oo_ in _soon_, but longer, \[ʊ\] before two consonants |
| P | \[p\] |
| R | \[ɾ\], tap, like the _tt_ in North American _butter_; some in Norway use \[ʁ\], the so-called _French R_ |
| rs | \[ʃ\], _r_ + _s_ combinations produce _sh_ sound, even between words |
| S | \[s\] |
| skj, ski, sky, sl | \[ʃ\], like the _sh_ in _ship_ or _shell_ |
| T | \[t\], silent after an e sometimes, ex. _det_ |
| U | \[ʉ\], like the _ew_ in _new_, but more closed |
| V | \[v\] |
| Y | \[y\] or \[ʏ\], like the _e_ in _email_, but more closed |

#### Norwegian vowels

Norwegian also has three special Norwegian vowels, **Æ**, **Ø** and **Å**.

| - | Similar To | IPA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Æ | the _a_ in _add_ or _apple_ | \[æ\] |
| Ø | no real equivalent, but not far from the vowel sounds in _bird_ or _earth_ | \[ø\] or \[œ\] |
| Å | the _o_ in _open_ or _old_ | \[o\] or \[ɔ\] |

> When you have no other option, you can use these replacement characters, but don't get into the habit of relying on them, as it will be a hard one to break.

| Character | Replacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Æ** | AE |
| **Ø** | OE |
| **Å** | AA |

#### Special Notes on Common Words

| Norweg. | Meaning | Pronunciation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **jeg** | I | _yai_, rhymes with English _guy_ |
| **er** | am, is, are | _ær_, similar to English _are_ but with tapped _r_ |
| **det** | it, that | _deh_, silent _t_ |
| **de** | they | _dee_ |

### Definite Forms

The definite form, _the man_, _the woman_, et cetera, is formed by attaching the indefinite article onto the end of the noun. This ending is called a postfix or a suffix.

| Indefinite |  | Definite |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| en mann | _a man_ | mannen | _the man_ |
| et barn | _a child_ | barnet | _the child_ |
| en gutt | a boy | gutten | the boy |
|  |  |  |  |

Although the _t_ is pronounced as such in the phrase **et barn**, it turns silent in the definite form, **barnet**, which is pronounced more like _barneh_. This is the case with all neuter nouns in the singular definite form.

> `Be sure to drop the *t* sound, otherwise you might sound rather Swedish.`

For feminine-classified nouns, there is one irregularity in the definite form:

| Indefinite |  | Definite |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ei kvinne **or** en kvinne | _a woman_ | kvinna **or** kvinnen | _the woman_ |
| ei jente **or** en jente | _a girl_ | jenta **or** jenten | _the girl_ |

Both **jenta** and **jenten** are appropriate translations for _the girl_. These same endings apply to all feminine nouns.

It is also normal to use the masculine article "en" for indefinite forms, even when preferring a feminine suffix in definite. This is not considered an error!

| Indefinite |  | Definite |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| en jente | _a girl_ | jenta | _the girl_ |
| en øy | _an island_ | øya | _the island_ |

### Plurals

With few exceptions, most masculine or feminine nouns \(most nouns\) pluralize with **-er** or **-r**.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| eple | _apple_ |
| epler | _apples_ |
| gutt | _boy_ |
| gutter | _boys_ |
| jente | _girl_ |
| jenter | _girls_ |

Single-syllable neuter nouns, such as **hus** _house_ and **dyr** _animal_, often do not change spelling in the indefinite plural.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| hus | _house_ **or** _houses_ |
| dyr | _animal_ **or** _animals_ |
| barn | _child_ **or** _children_ |
| brev | letters |

How then can you tell the difference between **hus** meaning _house_ and **hus** meaning _houses_? That depends on context and adjective endings, which we will cover a bit later in the course.

One exception to these rules is the Norwegian word for "man" which pluralizes in an irregular way that's almost identical to English:

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| mann | _man_ |
| menn | _men_ |

Here are some additional common irregular plurals, a couple of which are also irregular in English.

| Singular | Plural | English Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| and | ender | _duck - ducks_ |
| bok | bøker | _book - books_ |
| fot | føtter | _foot - feet_ |
| hånd | hender | _hand - hands_ |
| natt | netter | _night - nights_ |
| tann | tenner | _tooth - teeth_ |
| tre | trær | _tree - trees_ |

### Question Words

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **hvem** | who |
| **hva** | what |
| **hvor** | where |

Isn't it neat how they all resemble their English counterparts? You've probably noticed by now that English and Norwegian have many things in common, both when it comes to grammar and vocabulary. This is because they're closely related Germanic languages.
