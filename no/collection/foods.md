# Foods

In this skill, you'll learn the verb **lager**, which translates to _make_. There's no separate verb for cooking, instead, we use **lager mat**, literally _make food_.

> **Han lager mat**. He is cooking.
>
> the food: maten

## Measure Words

Remember that in Norwegian, the word for _of_, **av**, is omitted where one would normally use it in English to join a measure word with another noun.

| Norwegian | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| **en kopp kaffe** | _a cup of coffee_ |
| **et glass vann** | _a glass of water_ |

Neat, huh?
