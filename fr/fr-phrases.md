# Phrases\(fr\)

## Salut, Bonjour!

_Bonjour_ is a universal greeting that can be spoken to anyone at any time. In France, greeting people is very important, and some will even say _bonjour_ aloud when entering a public room or bus.

If you're being casual, you can say **Salut\(~hey\)** ! any time of day!

Bon après-midi is often used as a farewell in the afternoon, while **bonsoir** is an evening greeting. \( "bonsoir" is an evening hello and "bonne soirée" an evening goodbye.\)

**Greetings**:

| :--- | :--- |
| Bonjour, et bienvenue! | Hello/Good morning and welcome! |
| bonsoir | plus _bon matin_ in Québec only |
| Enchanté | Nice to meet you. |
|  |  |
|  |  |

**Farewells**:

| fr |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| bonne journée | \(have a\)good/nice day |
| bon\(ne\) après-midi | \(have a\)good noon \(note: un/une après-midi\) |
| bonne soirée | \(have a\)good evening |
| bonne nuit | \(have a\)good night/have a good night sleep |
| au revoir | It is more polite to add "monsieur, madame or mademoiselle" or the person's name after "au revoir". |
| À demain | See you tomorrow |
| à bientôt | See you soon |
| Adieu | old expression \(to God, forever goodbye\) |

> A good way to remember bonne soirée is to think of a party! Usually, parties happen in the evening. A soirèe is a French word, which means party. So whenever you see "bonne soirèe", just think of a party!

## How are you?

**Ça va** can be used both to ask how someone is doing and to answer the question!

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Salut, ça va\(bien\) ? | Hi, how are you?/Are you doing well? |
| Ça va \(très\) bien, et toi ? | I'm \(very\) fine/It's going \(very\) well/I am doing \(very\) well., and you? |
| Comment ça va ? | How are you doing? |

## Thank you

**Merci** is the most common way to say thank you or thanks in French.

You can use it whether you’re talking to your best friend, a seller, a waiter or your boss without any risk of offending anyone.

However, it may be considered a bit cold and short depending on the context.

That’s why it’s often better to expand on the basic merci and use one these common variations:

* Merci beaucoup \(thank you very much\)
* Merci d’avance \(thank you in advance\)
* Non merci \(no thank you\)
* Merci à tous \(thank you all\)

Sometimes you may also hear these alternative ways of saying thank you in French:

* Merci bien \(thanks a lot\)
* Merci infiniment \(thank you a million\)
* Merci mille fois \(thank you a thousand times\)
* Un grand merci à \(a big thank you to…\)
