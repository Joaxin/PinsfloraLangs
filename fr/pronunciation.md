# Pronunciation

```text
French word endings tend to be particularly difficult for beginners, largely because ending consonants are usually silent, but they do affect preceding vowel sounds.
```

| Ending | Homophones | Example | English Approximation | IPA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -er | -é, -ée, -ées | parler | cliché | \[e\] |
| -et | -ets, -è, -ê | poulet | pou-LAY | \[ε\] |
| -it | -its, -i, -ie, -ies, -is, -iz | lit | LEE | \[i\] |
| -at | -ats, -as, -a | chat | SHAH | \[ɑ\] |

The consonants C, R, F, and L are usually pronounced (you can use the mnemonic "CaReFuL"), with these main exceptions:
```

* An ending _-r_ is silent in infinitives \(e.g. _parler_ - to speak\).
* An ending _-fs_ is silent \(e.g. _œufs_ - eggs\).
* The L of an ending _-il_ is usually silent \(e.g. _fusil_ - gun\).

## The Mute E

When a consonant is followed by a mute _-e_, then the consonant should be pronounced. This is a way of distinguishing masculine and feminine forms verbally. Any unaccented _-e_ at the end of a word is always mute except in a single-syllable word like _le_, which sounds somewhat like "luh".

The letter E often becomes mute in the middle of a word, especially if it would add a syllable. For instance, most Francophones pronounce _appeler_ \("to call"\) as "app-LAY", not "app-pe-LAY".
