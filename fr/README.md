# French

Et je suis tr√®s heureuse :)

I had previously completed my French tree, but took a fairly long break from Duo and study (about five months). When I came back a little while ago, my tree was a colourful mess! It was pretty disheartening to see, but today I can proudly say that it is completely gold :) I have to say, it looks rather pretty!

I made this post both as a reward for myself (because I had to tell someone and I knew you guys would understand, haha) and as motivation for anyone else struggling to get their tree back on track after a break! I know it looks daunting, but it's a very satisfying thing to complete.

Bonne chance!
