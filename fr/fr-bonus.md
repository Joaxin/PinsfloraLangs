## Idioms

Many words or phrases cannot be translated literally between English and French because their usages are idiomatic. For instance, consider _« Ça va ? »_, which means "How are you?" The literal translation of the French is "That goes?", but this is nonsensical in English. It is very important to identify idioms in both languages and learn how to translate them properly.

Ça va, ça vient. \(It comes and goes.\)

Même pas mal ! \(Did not even hurt me! !\)

C'est n'importe quoi. \(This is nonsense.\)

Je n'en crois pas mes yeux ! \(I do not believe my eyes !\)
