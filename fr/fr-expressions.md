# French expressions

## Liaisons

In a **liaison**, an otherwise silent ending consonant is pushed to the next word, where it's pronounced as part of the first syllable. Like elisions, this prevents consecutive vowel sounds. Liaisons are possible whenever a silent ending consonant is followed by a word beginning in a vowel sound, but some liaisons are mandatory and others are forbidden.

Here are some mandatory liaisons, along with approximate pronunciations:

* Articles and adjectives with nouns. For example, _un homme_ \("uh-nohm"\), _mon orange_ \("mohn-norahnge"\), or _deux hommes_ \("duh-zohm"\).
* Pronouns and verbs. For example, _nous allons_ \("noo-zalohn"\) or _est-il_ \("ay-teel"\).
* Single-syllable adverbs and prepositions. For instance, _très utile_ \("tray-zuteel"\) or _chez elle_ \("shay-zell"\).

Liaisons are forbidden:

* Before and after _et_ \("and"\).
* After singular nouns \(including proper nouns and names\).
* After inversions \(which you'll learn in "Questions"\).
* Before an aspirated H \(e.g. _héros_ - "hero"\).
* After a nasal sound, except that _un_, _on_, and _en_ do liaise.

Note that some consonants take on a different sound in liaisons, and it's important to pronounce these correctly when speaking.

| Original Consonant | Resulting Liaison Sound | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| -s, -x, -z | Z | _des hommes_ \("day-zohm"\) |
| -d | T | _un grand arbre_ \("uhn-grahn-tarbre"\) |
| -f | V | _neuf ans_ \("nuh-vahn"\) |

Liaison rules vary among speakers, particularly across dialects, and fewer liaisons tend to appear in casual and slow speech. Note that the slow mode in Duo listening exercises does not include liaisons.

## Enchaînement

In **enchaînements**, ending consonant sounds are pushed onto the next word if it begins in a vowel. This is essentially the same as a liaison, except that the consonant sound wasn't silent beforehand. For instance:

* _elle est_ is pronounced like "eh-lay".
* _mange une pomme_ is pronounced like "mahn-jun-pom".

## The Impersonal Expression _Il Y A_

**Impersonal expressions** are phrases where there isn't a real subject. For instance, in the phrase "It is snowing" \(_Il neige_\), "it" doesn't refer to anything. It's a dummy subject that exists just to maintain the sentence structure.

One of the most common impersonal expressions is _il y a_, which is an idiom for "there is" or "there are".

* _Il y a une fille ici._ — There is a girl here.
* Il y a un garçon. \(There is a boy. )
* _Il y a un serpent dans ma botte !_ — There's a snake in my boot!

## "C'est" vs. "Il Est" Background

The French expressions _c'est_ and _il est_ are extremely important impersonal phrases. They can mean "this is," "that is," "it is," "they are," and even "he / she is." Both _c'est_ and _il est_ are well-used French sayings that date back centuries. _C'est la vie_ is a very old, very common French idiomatic saying, which means "That's life," and "Such is life." It has been around the world and back as a mainstay in dozens of cultures.

In France, it's still used in the same sense as always, as a sort of restrained, slightly fatalistic lamentation that this is how life is and there's not much you can do about it.

By contrast, _il est_ is a bit more straightforward—it means exactly what it says—as in the phrase _il est possible_, which means "it is possible."

Determining when to use _c'est_ versus _il est_ requires understanding the background behind each phrase as well as studying the use of the terms in context. Despite their similar meanings, the expressions _c'est_ and _il est_ are not interchangeable, as these examples show:

* _Paris? C'est magnifique!_ &gt; Paris? It's magnificent!
* _Il est facile d'apprendre le français._ &gt; It's easy to learn French.
* _C'est une fille sympa, Lise._ &gt; Lise? She's a nice girl.
* _Où est Paul? Il est en retard._ &gt; Where's Paul? He's late.

  C_'est_ has an undefined, exaggerated meaning, such as "Paris?It's magnificent!" By contrast, _il est_ is very literal, as in _Il est en retard._

\(He is late.\)

## "C'est" and "Il Est" Swapouts

C'est\* and _il est_ are the root forms, used for impersonal expressions and general comments, as in: It's interesting, It's nice, It's fortunate, and It's too bad.

When talking about specific people, things, or ideas, _c'est_ and _il est_ may change.

* _C'est_ becomes _ce_ _sont_ \(those are\) when followed by a plural noun. In spoken French, though, _c'est_ is often used anyway.
* _Il est_ becomes _elle_ _est_, _ils_ _sont_, or _elles_ _sont_ \(she is, they are, or they are\) as appropriate depending on the gender and number of the noun that it is replacing or modifying, as in:
* _Ce_ _sont_ _des Français? Non, des Italiens._ &gt; Are they French? No, Italian.
* _Voici Alice—\*\*elle_ _est_ _professeur\*\*._ &gt; This is Alice—she's a teacher.
