# Introduction

#### **Hawaiian spelling**

**ʻOkina**

The **ʻ** you will see in words like ʻae and ʻaʻole \(yes and no\), is called the ʻokina. The ʻokina is a glottal stop, which can be compared to the stopping of your voice between uh and oh in _uh-oh_. \(The name of this letter literally translates to "cutting off, separation".\)

**Kahakō**

The **¯** you will see in words like ʻōlelo \(language, speak\) and kāne \(man\) is called the kahakō. The kahakō prolongs a vowel.

It is important not to forget an ʻokina or a kahakō, because the word could have a very different meaning without them.

#### **E**

**Imperative E**

E is used before an action to signify a command or a suggestion. When you say, "E hele!", you're telling someone to "Go!"

**Vocative E**

E is used before a noun \(usually a person\) to indicate that the person is being addressed.

Ex. Mahalo, e Kawika. \(Thanks, Kawika.\) ➜ You are saying thanks to Kawika.

Aloha e Kaʻiulani. \(princess ka’iulani \)

> Here, “e” is a vocative particle marking “Ka’iulani” as the person being addressed.

E lei!

Give a lei!

> Guys, a lei is the garland of flowers that Hawaiians are known for making and wearing around their necks. I'm not Hawaiian but I'm fairly certain they are pretty important to the culture. That's why we are learning the term for them so early in the lessons.

ʻAʻole!

> No

Mahalo!

> Thanks

ʻAe

> Yes

E'ōlelo, e Kawika.

> Speak, Kawika.

E hele

> Go

Eʻai

> eat

#### **Determiners**

**Ke vs. Ka**

"Ka", "Ke" and "Nā" are determiners that can sometimes be translated as "the". Use **ke** when the noun that follows begins with the letters K, E, A, or O. Use **ka** with almost all others! This is commonly referred to as the KEAO rule. Warning: there will be exceptions \(don't worry, we'll let you know which ones they are!\).

**Plurals: nā**

**Nā** is only used to say "the" when the noun is plural. Certain words like "wahine" are pronounced with a longer "ā" when plural and hence spelled with a kahakō \(macron\), "wāhine".

**Kēlā & Kēnā**

"Kēlā" and "Kēnā" both mean "that". The difference is **kēlā** refers to "that" which is _away_ from the listener and **kēnā** refers to "that" which is _near_ the listener. Cultural note of interest: Hawaiians are keenly aware of space and time.

So in terms of distance from the speaker, remember this order: **kē**

| kēia |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| child | keiki |
| the boy | ke keiki kāne |
| that woman | kēlā wahine/pl. nā wāhine |
| the girl | ke kaikamahine |
| the children | nā keiki |
| that house | kēlā hale |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |

### **Aloha**

**Aloha** is used to express the feeling one feels when greeting someone or departing \(it may be love, sorrow, joy, etc.\). Therefore, this greeting of "aloha" always includes the speaker because "aloha" begins with the one who says it.

### **Personal Pronouns**

**"We"**

ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi has a few extra pronouns, in this skill you are introduced to two pronouns used for "we" which _includes the listener_. Think about it like, **kāua**= "you and I" = "WE 2" and **kākou**= "all of you and me" = "WE ALL". Eventually, you will learn that we also have two more pronouns for we that _exclude_ the listener \(māua and mākou\).

"Mai" directs the action toward the speaker and follows the action. "Mai" can also follow a few of the verbs in the Intro skill; hele, ʻōlelo and lei.
