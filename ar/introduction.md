# Introduction

## Reading back to front

Did you know that Arabic is written right to left?

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| d \(split shape d\) | د |
| aa | ا |
| daa | دا |

\(See? Right to left! How cool is that?\)

This means that when you pick up a book or magazine written in Arabic, you should start reading from the back cover — which, of course, is the front!

## Aah!!

When Arabic is written using English letters, sometimes there’ll be two vowels in a row.

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| daa | دا |
| duu | دو |
| dii | دي |

This doesn’t mean that there are two vowels in Arabic, but rather that there is one loooong vowel. Arabic has both short and long vowels!

## Oh, duh

When you see a tiny forward slash above a letter, it means this letter has a short ah sound right after it. We’ll talk more about this later.

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| d | د |
| da | دَ |

## Wow, yeah!

Sometimes و = **uu** \(long vowel\) and other times و = **w**.

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| zuu | زو |

**BUT**

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| zaw | زَو |
| wa | وَ |
| wuu | وو |

Same with the letter ي: sometimes ي = **ii** \(long vowel\) and sometimes ي = **y**.

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| zii | زي |

**BUT**

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| zay | زَ**ي** |
| ya | يَ |

The key is other vowels! If there is a vowel right **before or right** after و or ي, then they become w and y. Otherwise, they’re just the long vowels **uu** and **ii**.

## Mighty Morphing Power Letters

In English, letters can change shape, like if they’re uppercase or lowercase. Letters in Arabic, instead, change shape, based on where they are in comparison to other letters because they can connect to neighbouring letters. Look at the shapes of ب b:

| Position | Arabic letters | English letters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Independent | ب | b |
| Beginning of word | بَر/ بَز / باج | baaj / baz / bar |
| Middle of word | جَبَر | jabar |
| End of word | رَجَب | rajab |
|  | ذَوب | dhawb |

Letters can have up to four shapes, though some have fewer than that.

All letters have the independent form and the End of word form \(which means connecting to the previous letter\).

However, not all letters connect to the following letter → some letters don't have the beginning and middle of the word forms.

**ذ = dh**

The new letter ذ \(dhaal\) makes the same sound as the letter combination th in the following English words: the, this, brother, bathing. In our transliteration system, ذ will be represented as **dh**.

Note that this is **not** the same sound as th in the following set of English words: thick, thunder, broth, bath. This th sound corresponds to a different letter in Arabic that you will learn soon.

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| **dha** | **ذَ** |
| **dhawaa** | ذَوا |
| **dhawb** | ذَوب |
| **jad** | جَد |

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ka** | كَ |
| **kuu** | كو |
| **kadh** | كَذ |
| **zak** | زَك |

| English letters | Arabic letters |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ja** | جَ |
| **jaak** | جاك |
| **raaj** | راج |
|  |  |
