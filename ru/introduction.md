# Introduction

### Tips

 Russian does not have articles, nor does it normally use the verb “to be” in the Present tense.

 AN **EM-DASH** IS USED INSTEAD OF "THE VERB “TO BE” BETWEEN THE TWO NOUNS: «МОККА — КОФЕ» \("A MOCHA IS COFFEE"\).

 What is **EM-DASH**？

 In **TeX**：

 　for a hyphen, type a hyphen \(-\); 　　　for an en-dash, type two hyphens \(--\); 　　　for an em-dash, type three hyphens \(---\); 　　　for a minus sign, type a hyphen in mathematics mode \($-$\).

### Alphabet \(Алфавит, alfavit\)

 Russian uses a version of the **Cyrillic** Alphabet. Many letters look similar to their Latin counterparts. As Cyrillic typography was remodeled around 300 years ago, both alphabets have a similar style.

| Captilize | Lowercase | Latin / Greek |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. А | а | A / Α α |
| 2. Б | б | B / Β β |
| 3. В | в | V |
| 4. Г | г | G / Γ γ |
| 5. Д | д | D / Δ δ |
| 6. Е | е | E / Ε ε |
| 7. Ё | ё | Yo |
| 8. Ж | ж | Zh |
| 9. З | з | Z - Ζ ζ / Η η |
| 10. И | и | I / Ι ι |
| 11. Й | й |  |
| 12. К | к | K / Κ κ |
| 13. Л | д | L / Λ λ |
| 14. М | м | M / Μ μ |
| 15. Н | н | N / Ν ν - Ξ ξ |
| 16. О | о | O / Ο ο |
| 17. П | п | P / Π π |
| 18. Р | р | R / Ρ ρ |
| 19. С | с | S / Σ σ \( ς \) |
| 20. Т | т | T / Τ τ |
| 21. У | у | U / Υ υ |
| 22. Ф | ф | F / Φ φ |
| 23. Х | х | Kh / Χ χ |
| 24. Ц | ц | Ts / Ψ ψ |
| 25. Ч | ч | Ch - Ω ω |
| 26. Ш | ш | Sh |

### LETTERS AND SOUNDS

 **К**, **О**, **М**, **Т**, **А** sound similar to their Latin counterparts \(to be more precise, "о" is the sound in "more"\). However, in handwriting and typed italics, the letter **Т** can look rather like a lower case 'm' in the Latin alphabet. E.g. in the verb _просить_ \(to ask for, to request\), _т_ = t.

 **Е** actually sounds more like "ye", as in "yell", not as in "Hear ye, hear ye!" \(this will work for now; it's more complicated after a consonant\).

 **В** sounds like 'v', **Б** sounds like 'b'. **Н** is "n" and **И** is "i" \('eeh'\). The remaining letters are included in the table below:

|  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ёё⁰ \(**you**r\) | Вв \(**v**ase\) | Бб \(**b**ed\) |
| Ээ \(r**e**d\) | Нн¹ \(**n**ap\) | Дд¹ \(**d**ab\) |
| Уу \(s**oo**n\) | Хх² \(Ba**ch**\) | Гг \(**g**ap\) |
| Ии \(m**ee**t\) | Йй \(**y**es\) | Лл¹ \(ni**l**\) |
| Юю \(**you**\) | Рр \(trilled R\) | Пп \(**p**oor\) |
| Ыы³ \(h**i**t\) | Сс \(**S**am\) | Зз \(**z**ebra\) |
| Яя \(**ya**rd\) | Фф \(**ph**oton\) | Цц \(ca**ts**\) |
| Жж⁴ \(sei**z**ure\) | Шш⁴ \(**sh**un\) | Щщ⁴ |
| Чч \(**ch**eer\) |  | Ъ and Ь⁵ |

* ⁰ **Ёё** The umlaut-like double dots are optional in writing. Syllables containing this letter are always stressed.
* ¹ **т, д, н, л** are pronounced near your teeth
* ² **х**\('kh'\) is somewhat similar to the H in "hue". It is like making the "sh" sound, only it is pronounced where you make the "K" sound.
* ³ **ы** has no equivalent in English. It is an "eeh"-like sound, but less distinct, sounds closer to "e" in "lover", and has your tongue deeper that in "heat" or "hit".
* ⁴ for **ш** and **ж** your tongue is lower than in English and slightly bent back. **Щ** has all your tongue raised—it is a longer and more hissy sound. **Ч** corresponds to **щ** \(i.e. a bit different than "ch"\)
* ⁵ **ъ** and **ь** are separators and have no sound.

  **Л** can have a flat top, like **П**, or a pointy top like **А** \(it comes from the Greek Λ\). Д and Л have a similar top in many fonts, though it's up to the designer. Handwritten **Д** looks like _D_, and **д** like a _g_ or a _д_ \(the last two affect the italic shapes\).

  An Italic **Г** in lower case usually looks this: _г_.

### CASES AND WORD ORDER

Russian is an inflected language, so the forms of nouns and modifying adjectives correspond to their role in the sentence.

These forms are called **cases**. Russian has 6 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. The Nominative is the dictionary form; as for the others, we are going to cover them gradually, one by one.

This allows for a more loose word order. But not random! A typical word order is _subject—verb—object_. “Old” information \(the things you tell _about_\) is normally closer to the beginning of the sentence which is probably why pronouns are often found closer to the beginning of a sentence than a noun would be :

* _I know him._ → Я **его́** зна́ю.
* _I know Maria._ → Я зна́ю **Мари́ю**.

That includes words like “here”, “in this way”, “then” and so on.

Unlike English, adverbs are NOT universally grouped at the end. So pay attention to the typical positions for the expressions of time, place and manner. Eg. “very much” is typically in the end-position in English, but in Russian it is just before the thing that is "very" or “very much”:

* _She likes to read \*_very much**\* = Она́** о́чень\*\* лю́бит чита́ть

### VOWEL REDUCTION

Like in English, vowel letters aren't _all_ pronounced just like in the alphabet. In Russian, unstressed syllables have vowels _reduced_:

* **А and О** become the same uh-sound
* **И and Е** \(Э\) become the same sound similar to "i" in "hit"
* **Я** actually becomes an i-like sound, not an uh-like \(except in a few words\). This also affects "а" after ч,ш,щ,ж or ц in many words \(sadly, not all\).

So, when a vowel is not stressed, it becomes weaker, somewhat shorter, and also some vowels become indistinguishable.

The unstressed syllable is strongest just before the stress. In all other places it is even weaker than that \(though, some long words, especially compounds, may acquire a secondary stress\). This makes the system different from the English one, where stronger and weaker syllables tend to alternate.

### MORE ON THE CASE SYSTEM

For now, we only study simple sentences that either use the dictionary form, the _Nominative_ case, or use the _Accusative_ \(direct object of an action\), which has the same form for many classes of nouns.

The case is defined by its use. Nevertheless, these forms have names, usually calques from Latin that reflect some typical use \(but not the only one\):

* Nominative \(subject\)
* Accusative \(direct object\)
* Genitive \("of" something\)
* Prepositional \(place or topic\)
* Dative \(recipient, "indirect" object\)
* Instrumental \(means of action\)

As you can see, these names are of little use until you know what sentence, verb or preposition requires that you use that particular form.

* some nouns of foreign origin are _indeclinable_, i.e. all their forms are the same. This includes words like метро, Дженни or кафе.

### _I have a cat_

English prefers to express ownership and “possession” with the verb “have”. In Russian “existence” is almost universally used instead \(in the official/academic style «иметь» _to have_ is OK to use\).

Use it like that:

* **У A есть X** ~ by A there is an X → A has an X

The owner is in the _Genitive case_ \(more on that later\) while X is formally the subject. For now we will only study the Genitive form for some pronouns.

### _You \*_have_\* wonderful eyes!_

**Omit ”есть”** if the _existence_ of the object is obvious or not the point — very typical for describing traits or a number of objects \(“Tom has a beautiful smile/large eyes”, “She has a very fat cat”\). This also applies to expressing temporary states and illnesses \(“She has a migraine”\).

### _I eat/ She eat\*_s\*\*\*

In English, the only way a verb changes in the present tense is that you add -s for the 3rd person singular. In Russian, all 6 forms are different and fit two regular patterns.

However, **eat** «есть» and **want** «хоте́ть» are two of the four verbs that are irregular \(that is, do not strictly follow any of the 2 patterns\).

Note that the "present" tense is formed from one stem and the "past" and infinitive from the second one. In general, these two are slightly different. For now, don't worry about the infinitive stem.

### Hard and soft

Russian consonants are split into two groups of 15, which are pronounced in two different ways, _palatalized_ \(aka "soft"\) and _non-palatalized_ \(aka "hard"\). We'll stick to the shorter "soft" and "hard" \(sorry\).

When a consonant is "soft" it means than you pronounce it with you tongue raised high; for "non-palatalized" consonants it stays low. Russian orthography has its history but, long story short, you can tell the "softness" of a consonant from a vowel letter spelled afterwards:

* **А, Ы, У, Э, О** follow "hard" consonants
* **Я, И, Ю, Е, Ё** follow palatalized ones

If there is nothing after a consonant, the soft sign Ь is used to show the softness. In consonant clusters palatalization is predictable from the softness of the last consonant. We aren't teaching it here. These days the trend is to only "soften" the last consonant in most clusters, while a hundred years ago some clusters were palatalized even without any obvious reason.

To show you how it works, here is an example, using an ad-hoc transcription:

* же́**нщ**ина = \[жэнʲщиᵉна\]
* **ст**ена́ = \[стʲиᵉна\] or \[сʲтʲиᵉна\]

There are dictionaries \(«орфоэпический словарь»\) that show the recommended pronunciation of words and contain general pronunciation rules, too.

### Voicing

Some consonants let your voice come out immediately \(voiced\) while others wait for the release of the consonant and only then let your voice escape \(unvoiced\). In Russian there are 6 pairs of such consonants: Б/П, В/Ф, Г/К, Д/Т, Ж/Ш, З/С.

* whenever one of these consonants \(except В\) follows another, the second overrides or reverses the voicing of the first: сд = \[зд\], вс= \[фс\]
* the end of the phrase is unvoiced: этот клуб _\[клуп\]_
* rules apply between the word boundaries, too
* Х, Ч, Ц, Щ also play this game, even though Russian lacks letters for their voiced partners \(\[ɣ\], \[дж'\], \[дз\], \[ж'ж'\]\). They will devoice the preceding consonant or become voiced themselves.

**UNLIKE UKRAINIAN, RUSSIAN ONLY USES \[Ɣ\], \[ДЖ'\] AND \[ДЗ\] AS VOICED VARIANTS OF Х, Ч, Ц. UKRAINIAN HAS THEM AS FULL-FLEDGED CONSONANTS—THE ONES THAT ARE AN INTRINSIC PART OF A WORD AND CAN APPEAR ANYWHERE.**
