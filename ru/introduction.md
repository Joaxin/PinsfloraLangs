# Introduction

## Tips

Russian does not have articles, nor does it normally use the verb “to be” in the Present tense.

AN **EM-DASH** IS USED INSTEAD OF "THE VERB “TO BE” BETWEEN THE TWO NOUNS: «МОККА — КОФЕ» \("A MOCHA IS COFFEE"\).

What is **EM-DASH**？

In **TeX**：

for a hyphen, type a hyphen \(-\); for an en-dash, type two hyphens \(--\); for an em-dash, type three hyphens \(---\); for a minus sign, type a hyphen in mathematics mode \($-$\).

## CASES AND WORD ORDER

Now you are ready to proceed to the main part of the tree!

We are happy that you have chosen our Russian course. Just to make it clear, we are using American English in this course—but don't worry, we will accept most versions of English where appropriate. Just be careful around expressions like "bathroom" or "1st floor", because these may mean different things than what you are used to.

As for Russian, we teach the standard language, which is based on the variation spoken around Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and we stick to the usage typical of these cities. Do not worry, though: for more than one reason Russian is rather uniform over the territory of Russia \(still, there is some variation in pronunciation and a few items of everyday vocabulary\). We try to stay neutral in style, with occasional trips into formal and informal language.

Russian is an inflected language, so the forms of nouns and modifying adjectives correspond to their role in the sentence.

These forms are called **cases**. Russian has 6 cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Prepositional, Dative and Instrumental. The Nominative is the dictionary form; as for the others, we are going to cover them gradually, one by one.

This allows for a more loose word order. But not random! A typical word order is _subject—verb—object_. “Old” information \(the things you tell _about_\) is normally closer to the beginning of the sentence which is probably why pronouns are often found closer to the beginning of a sentence than a noun would be :

* _I know him._ → Я **его́** зна́ю.
* _I know Maria._ → Я зна́ю **Мари́ю**.

That includes words like “here”, “in this way”, “then” and so on.

Unlike English, adverbs are NOT universally grouped at the end. So pay attention to the typical positions for the expressions of time, place and manner. Eg. “very much” is typically in the end-position in English, but in Russian it is just before the thing that is "very" or “very much”:

* \_She likes to read \*\_very much**\* = Она́** о́чень\*\* лю́бит чита́ть

## VOWEL REDUCTION

Like in English, vowel letters aren't _all_ pronounced just like in the alphabet. In Russian, unstressed syllables have vowels _reduced_:

* **А and О** become the same uh-sound
* **И and Е** \(Э\) become the same sound similar to "i" in "hit"
* **Я** actually becomes an i-like sound, not an uh-like \(except in a few words\). This also affects "а" after ч,ш,щ,ж or ц in many words \(sadly, not all\).

So, when a vowel is not stressed, it becomes weaker, somewhat shorter, and also some vowels become indistinguishable.

The unstressed syllable is strongest just before the stress. In all other places it is even weaker than that \(though, some long words, especially compounds, may acquire a secondary stress\). This makes the system different from the English one, where stronger and weaker syllables tend to alternate.

## MORE ON THE CASE SYSTEM

For now, we only study simple sentences that either use the dictionary form, the _Nominative_ case, or use the _Accusative_ \(direct object of an action\), which has the same form for many classes of nouns.

The case is defined by its use. Nevertheless, these forms have names, usually calques from Latin that reflect some typical use \(but not the only one\):

* Nominative \(subject\)
* Accusative \(direct object\)
* Genitive \("of" something\)
* Prepositional \(place or topic\)
* Dative \(recipient, "indirect" object\)
* Instrumental \(means of action\)

As you can see, these names are of little use until you know what sentence, verb or preposition requires that you use that particular form.

some nouns of foreign origin are _indeclinable_, i.e. all their forms are the same. This includes words like метро, Дженни or кафе.

## _I have a cat_

English prefers to express ownership and “possession” with the verb “have”. In Russian “existence” is almost universally used instead \(in the official/academic style «иметь» _to have_ is OK to use\).

Use it like that:

* **У A есть X** ~ by A there is an X → A has an X

The owner is in the _Genitive case_ \(more on that later\) while X is formally the subject. For now we will only study the Genitive form for some pronouns.

## _You \*\_have_\* wonderful eyes!\_

**Omit ”есть”** if the _existence_ of the object is obvious or not the point — very typical for describing traits or a number of objects \(“Tom has a beautiful smile/large eyes”, “She has a very fat cat”\). This also applies to expressing temporary states and illnesses \(“She has a migraine”\).

## \_I eat/ She eat\*\_s\*\*\*

In English, the only way a verb changes in the present tense is that you add -s for the 3rd person singular. In Russian, all 6 forms are different and fit two regular patterns.

However, **eat** «есть» and **want** «хоте́ть» are two of the four verbs that are irregular \(that is, do not strictly follow any of the 2 patterns\).

Note that the "present" tense is formed from one stem and the "past" and infinitive from the second one. In general, these two are slightly different. For now, don't worry about the infinitive stem.
