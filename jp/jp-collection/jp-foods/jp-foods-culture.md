# Foods Culture

Japanese people usually say these phrases before and after eating. It's simply good etiquette to do so！ Before the meal，say いただきます \(itadakimasu, Let's eat！\). People also often put their hands together（like in prayer）while saying it to show their gratitude. The phrase comes from Japan's roots in Buddhism，which teaches respect for all living things. This includes the plants，the animals，and all the people who made your meal possible！ Afterwards，show your thanks again with こちそうさまでした.

いただきます \(頂きます\)

* Let's eat.

ごちそうさまでした。\(Gochisōsamadeshita.\)

* Thank you for the meal.
