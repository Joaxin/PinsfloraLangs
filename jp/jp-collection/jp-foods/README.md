あまい\(sweet, amai\)

## **Object Particle**

You do something to a noun，like when you eat something or drink something，you put **を** after the thing that receives the action.

The marker **を** is attached to things or people, and means that they are the target of the verb. Subjects are often omitted in Japanese sentences. Unlike English, the location of the verbs are usually at the end of the sentence. を was once pronounced wo, but now it’s the \[o\] sound.

To say something like I do not eat or I do not drink，just change ます to ません！Like with questions，it's common to use は in the negative sentences，instead of を .
