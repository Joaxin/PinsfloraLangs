# Phrases

### _Negations_

The English _no_ has two main uses:

* Particle \(e.g. "no!"\): this translates directly to the Italian _no_.
* Determiner \(e.g. "no one"\): you'll learn the translations for this in a later section.

The English _not_ almost always translates to the Italian _non_. However, while _not_ often follows the verb it negates or its auxiliary, the Italian _non_ always precedes it.

### _Greetings_

* _Ciao_ is used both ways in Italian: when meeting \(also _salve_\) and when parting \(also _arrivederci_ or _addio_\).
* _Buongiorno_ and _buonasera_ are normally used when meeting, although they can be used when parting as well: the first is used in the first half of the day and the latter in the remaining half.
* _Buonanotte_ is always used when parting, as it presumes that the day is over \(same as "good night"\).
* _Prego_ is a courtesy form used in many occasions to accompany a kind action, and it's the customary answer to reply to received thanks.
* _Per favore_, _per piacere_ and _per cortesia_ are courtesy forms used when asking for something.
