# Phrases\(it)

## Ciao

You can say ciao regardless of the time of day, as long as you' re speaking informally or to family or friends.

Ciao \(Hello/goodbye.\) is used both ways in Italian: when meeting \(also salve\) and when parting \(also arrivederci or addio\).

## Greetings

Buongiorno \(Good morning\) and buonasera \(Good evening\) are normally used when meeting, although they can be used when parting as well: 

the first is used in the first half of the day and the latter in the remaining half(both good afternoon and good evening).

Note that buonanotte is used to say goodbye at night or is always used when parting, as it presumes that the day is over \(same as "good night"\). It can't be used to greet people.

## Sorry

Io sono spiacente. \(I am sorry.\)

Sì, spiacente.\(Yes, Sorry\)

## Thanks

Good manners are important! Use grazie to thank people, and per favore to say please.

Per favore, per piacere and per cortesia\(please.\) are courtesy forms used when asking for something.

When someone says grazie to you,be sure to reply prego!

Prego\(You are welcome! \) is a courtesy form used in many occasions to accompany a kind action, and it's the customary answer to reply to received thanks.



E Lei di dovè? \(Where are you from?\)
