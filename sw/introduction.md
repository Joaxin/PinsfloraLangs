# Introduction

## Genders

**e.g.**

en man **/** kvinna \(A man / woman\)

Mannen **/** Kvinnan \(The man / woman\) \(Män / kvinnor\)

en pojke **/** flicka

Pojken **/** Flickan \(The boy / The girl\) \(Pojker / flickor\)

ett äpple

That seems a bit overkill - but it is actually quite logical \(Swedes like logic\). There are two kinds of gender – natural \(male and female\) and grammatical gender in Swedish.

English only uses natural gender ("he" for males, "she" for females and "it" for objects) whereas Romance languages such as French use natural genders ("he" and "she") as grammatical gender as well (everything is thus either a "he" or a "she" in French).

Swedish has a double system. When talking about people, we use the natural gender (he and she) but when we aren't talking about humans, you have to look at the grammatical gender. Swedish words belong either to the en-words (also called n-words, common gender or utrum) or to the ett-words (also called t-words, neuter or neutrum).

The names en-words and ett-words are derived from the indefinite article (singular) of each group, both corresponding to a(n) in English.

When talking about people, will use the natural gender \(he and she\) but when we aren't talking about humans, you have to look at the grammatical gender. Swedish words belong either to the **en-words** \(also called _n-words_, _common gender_ or _utrum_\) or to the **ett-words** \(also called _t-words_, _neuter_ or _neutrum_\).

The names **en-words** and **ett-words** are derived from the indefinite article \(singular\) of each group, both corresponding to **a\(n\)** in English.

Examples

| Female | Male | En-words | Ett-words |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **hon** _she_ | **han** _he_ | **den** _it_ | **det** _it_ |

## _det är_

In Swedish, when start talking about something new, or point out what something is, we use the construction _det är_.

It is a lot like _it is_ in English, but there's an important difference: the Swedish construction never changes. We use it for _ett_ words and _en_ words, for people and for plural objects, and it's **always** _det är_.

* Det är ett äpple\* – It is an apple
* _Det är en bok_ – It is a book
* Det är en flicka\* – It is a girl
* Det är tidningar\* – They are newspapers

## _This_ and _that_

You're going to learn about this more in depth later, but in case you wonder if you couldn't just say this or that when we say det är, here's the deal:
There are two ways to say this in Swedish: either det här/den här or detta/denna.
The Swedish counterpart to that is det där/den där, but sometimes you can also use det/den to mean that.
Those words are taught a little later in the course so you don't need to worry about them just yet, but just in case you were wondering.
