# Introduction

## Welcome to the Hebrew course!

We are very excited that you have chosen to learn Hebrew. Remember that you can access the Tips and Notes from a lesson at any time by clicking the top-left corner, or by clicking the lightbulb if you are using Duolingo with skill levels enabled.

Before we get started, just be aware that the Hebrew language is written from **right to left!**

## The Hebrew Alphabet

In Hebrew there are 22 letters, some of their sounds exist in English and some don't. A few letters have an ending form - that means that those letters look different when written at the end of a word \(their pronunciation **does not change**\).

Each letter is given with the pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet \(IPA\) and a close-matching example in English:

\(Letters in blue are taught in this skill\)

| Name | Letter | Ending form | IPA | English example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aleph | א |  | /ʔ/ | **uh** \(usually silent or similar to the letter "a" in English: a placeholder for vowels\)\*\* |
| Bet | ב |  | /b/\*,/v/ | bet, vet |
| Gimel | ג |  | /g/ | **g**o |
| Dalet | ד |  | /d/ | **d**og |
| Hey | ה |  | /h/ | **h**en \(often silent in modern colloquial speech\) |
| Vav | ו |  | /v/ | **v**et |
| Zayin | ז |  | /z/ | **z**oo |
| Chet | ח |  | /X/ | lo**ch** |
| Tet | ט |  | /t/ | **t**en |
| Yod | י |  | /j/ | **y**es |
| Kaf | כ | ך | /k/\*, /X/ | **c**at, lo**ch** |
| Lamed | ל |  | /l/ | **l**og |
| Mem | מ | ם | /m/ | **m**an |
| Nun | נ | ן | /n/ | **n**o |
| Samekh | ס |  | /s/ | **s**ee |
| Ayin | ע |  | /ʔ/, /ʕ/ | **uh** |
| Pei | פ | ף | /p/\*,/f/ | **p**ay, **f**ool |
| Tsadi | צ | ץ | /ts/ | ca**ts** |
| Qof | ק |  | /k/ | **c**at |
| Resh | ר |  | /ʁ/ | **r**un \(similar to the French r\) |
| Shin | ש |  | /ʃ/,/s/ | **sh**e, **s**ee |
| Tav | ת |  | /t/ | **t**ap |

\*These sounds are pronounced only when the letter is at the beginning of the word or at the beginning of a syllable. Otherwise, the other sound is usually the one that is pronounced.

\*\*A common example for the use of "א" as a silent letter is the word לא \(/lo/\), which means "no".

## The letter "vav" \(ו\)

The basic sound of the letter "vav" is "v". However, it is also used in Hebrew as the vowel "u" and "o".

For example:

* א**ו**הב = \(**o**hev\).
* ה**ו**א = \(h**u**\).

## Articles

Hebrew has only a definite article \(_i.e. "the"_\). This means that there are no indefinite articles \(i.e. "a/an"\). In order to add the definite article to a noun we simply attach the letter ה to the beginning of the noun.

For example:

ילד - boy/a boy \(_yéled_\)

הילד = ה + ילד - the boy \(the "ה" as a definite article is pronounced _Ha_ - i.e. **ha**yéled\).

\(Throughout the notes we add accents \[like these: áéíóú\] merely to show which syllable is stressed. In this case **ye**led and not ye**led**\)

## Connecting words

In order to connect words in Hebrew using the word "and", we attach the letter **ו** \(vav\) to the beginning of the second word. When using it to connect words, the letter **ו** will usually sound like "ve".

For example:

ילדה - a girl \( _yalda_\)

ילדה וילד = ילדה ו + ילד - a girl and a boy \(yalda **ve**yeled\)

We can also use both **ה** and **ו** together \("the" and "and"\):

והילד = ו + ה + ילד - **and the** boy \(**ve-ha**-yeled\)

## Yes/No questions

Yes/No questions in Hebrew do not change the sentence structure. You can simply add a question mark in writing, and in speech, you can use a questioning intonation.

For example:

> אני אבא \(aní ába\) - I am a father.
>
> ?אני אבא \(aní ába?\) - Am I a father?

We can also add the word "האם" \(ha-ím\) in order to emphasize that a question is being asked, but it is considered formal, and is therefore not very common in spoken Hebrew.

For example:

> אני אבא \(aní ába\) - I am a father.
>
> ?האם אני אבא \(ha-ím aní ába?\) - Am I a father?

## The verbs "לבוא" and "לאהוב"

In this lesson we come across our first two verbs - לבוא \(to come\) and לאהוב \(to love/like\). We are not going to teach verb conjugation yet, but just to clarify what we're dealing with:

בא \(ba\) - "comes" for singular _masculine_ nouns.

באה \(ba'a\) - "comes" for singular _feminine_ nouns.

אוהב \(ohév\) - "loves/likes" for singular _masculine_ nouns.

אוהבת \(ohévet\) - "loves/likes" for singular _feminine_ nouns.
