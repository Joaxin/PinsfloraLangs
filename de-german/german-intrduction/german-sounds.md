# German Sounds

Some letters in German make a different sound than in English. Let’s go over a couple of them!

**W**asser, **w**ir, **W**ein, as in “vine/van”

**J**unge, **j**a, as in “yes”

i**ch**, Mäd**ch**en, lei**ch**t, ni**ch**t, schle**ch**t as in "humid", but stronger

> With the **ch** sound, you should be able to feel air if you hold your hand in front of your mouth, and it kind of sounds like a cat hissing!

**sp**äter, **sp**rechen，s sounds like sh

**Sch**nee, Engli**sch**，as in “shop”

**Tsch**üss, Deu**tsch**，as in “cheese”

**Pf**erd, **Apf**el, as in “ca**pf**ul”

**V**ogel, **v**erstehen, as in “**f**un”

## **I’m zo zorry**

Careful, some letters change their pronunciation in certain situations! Before a vowel, the letter **s** makes the sound of an English **z**!

**s**auber, **s**üß, **S**aft as in “**z**oo”

## Bach

Earlier, we practiced how to say that soft **ch** sound \(like in **h**umid\).

When a **ch** comes after an **a** or **u**, the sound is harsher and farther back in the throat, almost like the sound some people make before spitting.

schwa**ch**, Na**ch**t, Bu**ch** like “lei**ch**t”, but even harsher

Another sound made in the back of the throat is the German **r** at the beginning of words. It’s similar to gargling or a cat purring.

**r**uhig, **r**und, **R**eis like gargling

## Umlauts

**Umlauts** are letters \(more specifically vowels\) that have two dots above them and appear in some German words like "Mädchen."

_Literally, "Umlaut" means "around the sound," because its function is to change how the vowel sounds._

| no umlaut | umlaut |
| :--- | :--- |
| a | ä\(ae\) |
| o | ö\(oe\) |
| u | ü\(ue\) |

The umlaut changes the sound of the vowel a bit!

Wasser, Mann, as in “father”

Mädchen, Männer, as in “bed”

An umlaut can sometimes indicate the plural of a word. For example, the plural of "Mutter" \(mother\) is "Mütter."

## **ß\(ss\)**

German has a special letter called the **Eszett**, which looks like ß. It sounds like s as in say!

heißen, ich heiße as in “say”

## **g2g**

ferti**g**, trauri**g**, lusti**g** as in “**h**umid”, but stronger

In German, the **‑ig** at the end of a word sounds the same as

**ich**

**g**esund, **g**ut, **G**emüse as in “**g**ood”

Note that in German, **g** never has the **j** sound like in the English word **g**ym.

## **The letter e**

The letter **e** sounds different depending on where it is in a word!

B**er**g, St**er**n, l**er**nen as in “**ai**r”

l**e**ben, s**e**hen, g**e**hen as in “l**ay**”

Sonn**e**, Bäum**e**,Erd**e**, relaxed **uh** sound, as in “s**u**pport”

## o

Practice the difference so you don’t say the wrong word! sch**o**n, as in “h**o**me” sch**ö**n, similar to “h**u**rt” For the ö sound, try saying **a** \(as in f**a**ther\), then round your lips like you’re drinking from a straw!

## **Zeug**

The word **Zeug** has two great sounds for us to practice!

**Z**eug, **Z**eitung, **z**u as in “cat**s**”

Z**eu**g, D**eu**tsch, **eu**er \(as in “b**oy**”\)
