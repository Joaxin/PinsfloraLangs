# Introduction

Dutch is a Germanic language, with grammar and vocabulary similar to other European languages. You might recognize some words from English as well! Even so, Dutch is a language with grammatical genders.

### Gender and Articles

In Dutch, there are three \(grammatical\) **genders**: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Each gender has their own definite article the.

Both singular masculine and feminine nouns use `de` , and singular neuter nouns use `het`.

For plural nouns, _de_ is always used. The definite articles _de_ and _het_ don't have very clear rules for when you're supposed to use which; this will mostly be learning by heart and developing a feeling for it. However, there are some guidelines to help you along:

**De words**:

de melk

de krant\(newspaper\)

1. _De_ is always used for plural nouns
2. _De_ is always used for professions: _de kok_ \(‘the chef’\), _de leraar_\(‘the teacher’\)
3. _De_ tends to be used for people with an identified gender, such as:

   | m | f | m | f |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | de vader | de moeder |  |  |
   | de man | de vrouw |  | het kind |
   | de zoon | de dochter | de jongen**s** | het meisje**s** |

4. _De_ is used for vegetables, fruits, trees and plants, names of mountains, and rivers. and

   e.g. de appel

5. Furthermore, _de_ is used for most words ending on **-ie, -ij, -heid, -teit, -schap, -tie, -sie, -aar, -eur, -er**, and **-or**.
6. Finally, _de_ is used for written-out numbers and letters: _de drie_\(‘the three’\), _de a_ \(‘the a’\).

**Het words**:

het water

het brood

het boek

het menu

1. _Het_ is always used for diminutives. Diminutives can be recognised by their suffix; they end in **-je, -tje, -etje, -pje**, or **-mpje**.

   Het meisje met de parel

   * the girl with the pearl earring

2. _Het_ is always used for words consisting of two syllables and starting with **be-, ge-, ver-**, and **ont-**
3. Het is always used for verbs used as nouns. When the infinitive form of a verb is used as a noun

   e.g. the walking of the dog\(het lopen van de hond\).

4. _Het_ is always used for languages and names of metals
5. _Het_ is also used for names of compass points: _het noorden_ \(‘the North’\)
6. _Het_ is used for names of sports and games: _het schaken_ \(‘chess’\), _het voetbal_ \(‘football/soccer’\)
7. Furthermore, _het_ is used for words ending on **-isme** and **-ment**

> Dutch speakers actually never tend to think about the gender of words. Rather than knowing whether a word is originally feminine or masculine, the only distinction that has to be remembered is the difference between the _de words_ and _het words_.

> This is because it has grammatical consequences \(in terms of possessives, question words, demonstratives, adjectives, and even relative pronouns\). This is why when you learn a new noun, it is very important to memorize whether it is a _de_ or _het word_.

**De jongen eet een appel.**

The boy eats an apple.

### Pronouns

The Dutch pronouns are as follows:

| English | Dutch |
| :--- | :--- |
| I | Ik |
| You \(singular\) | Jij \(Je\*\) |
| He/She/It | Hij/Zij \(Ze\*\)/Het |
| You \(formal\) | U |
| We | Wij \(We\*\) |
| You \(plural\) | Jullie |
| They | Zij \(Ze\*\) |

* _\*Je, ze_ and _we_ are un-emphasized forms of _jij, zij_ and _wij_.

### Verb conjugation

In Dutch, verbs can be recognised by the ending **-en**. For example, _eten_ \(‘to eat’\) and _drinken_ \(‘to drink’\). Verb conjugation in Dutch can get rather difficult, since there are lots of exceptions.

For the simple present, the conjugation is as follows:

| Pronoun | Conjugation | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ik | \[stem\] | Ik drink \(_I drink_\) |
| Jij | \[stem\]+t | Jij drinkt \(_You drink_\) |
| Hij/Zij/Het | \[stem\]+t | Hij drinkt \(_He drinks_\) |
| U | \[stem\]+t | U drinkt \(_You drink_\) |
| Wij | Infinitive | Wij drinken \(_We drink_\) |
| Jullie | Infinitive | Jullie drinken \(_You drink_\) |
| Zij | Infinitive | Zij drinken \(_They drink_\) |

lees/lez\(read\)

spreek\(speak\)

> I speak English.
>
> * Ik spreek Engels.
>
> He speaks a bit of Dutch.
>
> * Hij spreekt een beetje Nederland.

**Irregular verbs**

 Unfortunately, Dutch also has irregular verbs. Fortunately, there are only **6** verbs that are completely irregular.

These are the irregular verbs:

1. Hebben \(to have\)
2. Kunnen \(can\)
3. Mogen \(may\)
4. Willen \(to want\)
5. Zijn \(to be\)
6. Zullen \(shall\)

The most common of these are _Hebben_ and _Zijn_, so here are their conjugations in the present tense:

| Hebben | Zijn |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ik heb | Ik ben |
| Jij hebt | Jij bent |
| U hebt/U heeft | U bent |
| Hij/Zij/Het heeft | Hij/Zij/Het is |
| Wij hebben | Wij zijn |
| Jullie hebben | Jullie zijn |
| Zij hebben | Zij zijn |

### Negation

In Dutch, there are two words that are used to negate things: _niet_ and _geen_. They are, however, not interchangeable. And since this is Dutch, there are some exceptions to this rule as well.

**Geen**

_Geen_ is used to negate **a noun** that, if not negated, would be preceded by _een_. You can say that _geen_ translates to ‘not a’. _Geen_ is also used if the noun is not preceded by any article, like some plural and uncountable nouns.

| Dutch | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| Is dat een man? – Nee, dat is **geen** man. | Is that a man? – No, that is not a man. |
| Hebben zij boeken? – Nee, zij hebben **geen** boeken. | Do they have books? – No, they don’t have books. |

Note that _geen_ can always be translated as the English word "no": That is no man. They have no books. For _niet_, this is almost never the case.

**Niet**

_Niet_ is essentially used in all other situations:

1. To negate verbs, thoughts, adjectives, or any other sentence elements that aren’t nouns.
2. To negate nouns preceded by a definite article or possessive pronoun.

| Dutch | English |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ik ren niet. | I do not run. |
| Hij is niet zo oud. | He is not that old. |
| Zij hebben de boeken niet. | They do not have the books. |
| De man heeft het menu niet. | The man does not have the menu. |

As you can see in the last example, _niet_ comes after the object, unlike _geen_. If it is used to negate an adjective or adverb, it comes directly before that word.
