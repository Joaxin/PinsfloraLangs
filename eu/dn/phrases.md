### Greetings

As in English, Dutch has many different ways of greeting others. The most common one, which you can use all day, is _Hallo_.

An easy way of greeting people throughout the day, is to say the time of day and add goed**e**- "good" in front of it - just like in English.

 If the time of day starts with a vowel, you squish an **-n-** in between \(an exception being "goede**n**dag"\). As follows:

| Time of day | Greeting |
| :--- | :--- |
| Morgen \(morning\) | Goede**morgen** |
| Middag \(midday\) | Goede**middag** |
| Avond \(evening\) | Goeden**avond** |
| Nacht \(night\) | Goeden**acht** / welterusten |
| Dag \(day\) | Goeden**dag** |
